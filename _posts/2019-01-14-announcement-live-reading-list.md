A quick update: you can now find an OPML export of all of the dev/tech feeds I read at <https://SeanKilleen.com/reading-list>.

The page has more information, but if you're ever curious what dev & tech blogs I'm reading, you can see them anytime and read them yourself.

More information is on the [reading list page](https://SeanKilleen.com/reading-list), and I'll have a how-to blog / talk coming soon how I did it.
