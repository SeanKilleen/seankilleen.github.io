### Problem:

Crystal Reports 2008 Designer does not reflect changes made to views or stored procedures, even after refreshing the database and those views/procedures within Crystal.

### Solution

While a horrible user experience, there is a proper method to accomplish this.

Based on trips from [this helpful article]:

* From the `Database` menu, click `Verify Database`.
* If dealing with a stored procedure, you will be asked to enter parameters; enter correct ones.
* Crystal Reports will undergo a verification process, during which time it will find the extra fields and adjust the report accordingly.

No idea why this is separate from (and ambiguously named compared to) a right-click and "refresh", but it does the job.
