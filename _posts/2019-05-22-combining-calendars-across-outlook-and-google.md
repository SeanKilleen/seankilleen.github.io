This came up in a conversation and I realized my methods might be helpful for someone. I figured I can write it up with step-by-steps here.

My response: 

On Windows, I use Outlook Google Calendar Sync --  Free, OSS app. Sits in your system tray and does a sync from Excella --> GCal since that's how I have it set up. I sync my Excella to a Google calendar called "work" that I overlay with my personal calendar in Google Cal. https://phw198.github.io/OutlookGoogleCalendarSync/

If you want the reverse and want to overlay your personal calendar in your outlook, you can do that with google calendar too. Open the sharing settings for the calendar, get a shareable link. I then believe you can "add a calendar from the internet" in outlook, paste that link, and it should show up (I don't do this currently though).

EDIT: My above information was a little old for getting GCal into outlook. If you want to do that, you actually:

• Go into google calendar settings
• Scroll into "Integrate Google Calendar" section
• Copy the "secret address in iCal format"
• Go into your outlook account settings
• Go to the "internet calendars" tab
• Hit new & paste the URL
