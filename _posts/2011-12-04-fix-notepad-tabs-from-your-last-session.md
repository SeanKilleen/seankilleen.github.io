Just found myself doing this again on the new setup; figured it might be worth posting.

### Problem:

When opening Notepad++ after previously closing it, the application loads all the old files you were working on last time.

### Solution

This is by design, and may be useful for some users. If it's not your thing, and you want to remove it:

* Click `Settings > Preferences`
* Click the `MISC.` tab
* Uncheck the box labeled `Remember current session for next launch`.
