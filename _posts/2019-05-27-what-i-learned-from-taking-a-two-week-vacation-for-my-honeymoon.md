My wife and I recently took our honeymoon a year and a half after we got married. It was the longest vacation I've ever taken, and probably the first one I can remember where I didn't bring my laptop. 

And wow, did I learn a _lot_ about burn-out, my relationship with technology, and my own personal reserve levels.

I wanted to share these thoughts because they were revelatory for me.

* My normal reserves were not near 90%; they were near 50%
* A break makes so many things that seem normal seem crazy
* I struggle a lot more with context switching than I think
* I don't often recognize that I put myself in the positions that I do (e.g. I HAVE to do something, when it's something nobody asked me to do)
* My anxieties cause me to be selfish, which leads to several bad habits. I deserve that drink! I don't have time to plan to cook a meal! I don't want to do that chore/errand! I need to unwind even if it means not sleeping until 1:30am!
* Caffeine is enabling the worst of me rather than allowing me to get by
* I never define what space I have, and so all sorts of things bleed into it.
* I like myself better when I'm calmer and present
* Presence is key in so many ways. I was absolutely failing at this while thinking I was great
* Notifications are a big trigger for me
* I don't need to be the guy with the real-time response. I liked that part of my identity and felt strongly about it. I think I might kill it off now.
* Time boxing and being intentional, especially outside of work hours, are going to be key for me.
* Sleep is so crucial to me, and I neglect it all the time.
* I half ass too many things. I need to whole ass less things.
