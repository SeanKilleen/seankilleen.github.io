My wife and I recently took our honeymoon a year and a half after we got married. It was the longest vacation I've ever taken, and probably the first one I can remember where I didn't bring my laptop. 

And wow, did I learn a _lot_ about burn-out, my relationship with technology, and my own personal reserve levels. (in addition to being the best trip of our lives of course!)

I wanted to share these thoughts because they were revelatory for me.

## What I realized

* **My idea of what my baseline was for emotional reserves was completely off.** For the longest time, I thought that in terms of "emotional reserves", I was operating near 90%, or 80% on tough weeks. That was probably closer to 50% on good days. It wasn't until I stepped away that I saw how years of stress across multiple jobs had eroded my idea of what normal is. It felt phenomenal to actually feel back to normal, vs what I had previously considered normal. It immediately spurred me to write this to capture the feeling.
* **I struggle a lot more with context switching than I think**. When on vacation, being in the moment and not  checking a gazillion things, I realized that each of the contexts I operate in requires "context vigilance". That's background work that's happening all the time. I thought that I had these contexts managed -- and on the surface, I did -- but it turns out that all of that background noise was diminishing my quality of life way more than I'd realized.
* **Focus is a joy and being present should be a minimum requirement**. Being fully present -- as opposed to what I previously thought of as being present -- was so uplifting. Calming my background thoughts showed me how much my wife appreciated my presence, and how much better I felt being able to take things in without my brain constantly hijacking me to worry about other contexts. 
* **I don't often recognize that I put myself in the positions that I do**. Having some space made me realize that I do a lot of things because I think I have to do them, but a lot of times nobody put me in that position except me. Other people exist who can do those things, and not everything needs to get done immediately. 
* **My anxieties cause me to be selfish, which leads to several bad habits**. I deserve that drink! I don't have time to plan to cook a meal! I don't want to do that chore/errand! I need to unwind even if it means not sleeping until 1:30am! I can show up on less sleep! These are all kinds of things that I've said to myself after long days of switching contexts and being low-key anxious in the background when I didn't even realize it.
* Caffeine is enabling the worst of me rather than allowing me to get by
* I never define what space I have, and so all sorts of things bleed into it.
* I like myself better when I'm calmer and present
* Presence is key in so many ways. I was absolutely failing at this while thinking I was great
* Notifications are a big trigger for me
* I don't need to be the guy with the real-time response. I liked that part of my identity and felt strongly about it. I think I might kill it off now.
* Time boxing and being intentional, especially outside of work hours, are going to be key for me.
* Sleep is so crucial to me, and I neglect it all the time.
* I half ass too many things. I need to whole ass less things.

## What I'm Doing About It

* **Deleting lots of apps.** If I don't need it, I probably can do without it or load it later. This reduces the interruptions, desire to check a gazillion apps, etc.
* **Notifications are going away for all that ping me the most**. I check Twitter, Slack, and E-mail enough. No reason for them to also ping me when I check them so regularly.
* One cup of coffee per weekday, and only in the morning.
* Be aware of when I feel I "need" or "deserve" something. 
* Re-reading Essentialism.
