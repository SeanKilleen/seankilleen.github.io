### Problem:

In a new install of SQL Server 2008, when attempting to save changes to a table in a new database, I occasionally get the following error:

> Saving changes is not permitted. The changes you have made require the following tables to be dropped and re-created. You have either made changes to a table that can't be re-created or enabled the option Prevent saving changes that require the table to be recreated.

### Solution

Per [this excellent article on MSDN help], take the following steps to rid yourself of this error:

* `Tools > Options`
* Expand the `Designers` Section
* Click the `Table and Database Designers` section
* Uncheck the box labeled `Prevent saving changes that require table re-creation.`

### Caveat

**Don't do this on a production database**. Just don't do it. I only needed this for a quick temporary database, or when working in design mode. Otherwise, this option should always be enabled.
