_This is part of a series called Culture > Tactics, where I attempt to break down some of the misconceptions and how teams should orient themselves towards cultural changes rather than tactical changes._

Oftentimes, companies begin an "Agile Transformation" or exploration, only to settle for "doing Scrum", "implementing DevOps", or "Kanban boards" as a substitute for real change. This cargo cult mentality and focus on tactical improvement is missing the larger picture. It's not about "being agile" or some half-baked idea of what that means. It's about the real value provided to a business by re-evaluating the way you approach delivering on your company's goals. 

If you're investing in agility but only considering tactical improvements or outcomes, you're going to be stuck wondering why your investments aren't paying off. This article talks a bit about the "why". 

## Changing the Outputs vs Changing Your Trajectory

Too often, companies and their leadership make an investment in the tactical side of things -- producing widgets \`x%\` faster, releasing \`y times\` per month. Agile methodologies are seen as a way to improve on these metrics.

But what if you were able to put a new lens on your entire organization? What if you were able to challenge assumptions, experiment, build a culture of learning and leadership, focus on organizational clarity and alignment around a vision? Organizations and team often focus on "up and to the right", but see this is a straight slope or something that should be achieved quickly and consistently. In reality, if you invest in changing the mindset and culture of your organization, it will take a little more time for those seems to germinate, and things will bloom unevenly. But when the change shows up, it is more beneficial than you could have imagined.  

I know it's possible. I've seen it done. I've also seen most organizations stop short of it, believing the end-goal impossible, or being unwilling to commit.

## Change is the \*whole point\*

If you're looking for new terms or tools -- Agile, Scrum, SAFe, Kanban -- but are only considering how they fit into your current process / thinking, you may not be going about growing your organization the right way. The goal is to figure out how your business can be better, more evolved to fulfill your organization's vision quickly -- not to put a buzzword bandage on your existing environment. 

## Agile Isn't Something The Developers Do.

Or rather, adopting an agile mindset isn't something that _only the development team_ does.

If the leaders in your company aren't willing to invest themselves in reconsidering how their culture could be improved, they're only considering the tactical approaches to agility, and their ROI will be considerably limited, leading to potential backlash.

Leaders need to show up if they want their company to succeed. If you're considering new mindsets, adaptations, and culture, it's important that the leadership embraces this to create a space where it can thrive. 

Many folks (including me, oftentimes) reiterate that Agile is a mindset, not a methodology. And in order to think about things differently, you need to understand that the organizational structure embraces experimenting with different kinds of thought. That has to come from leaders.

I once had a client -- in the role of Product Owner -- tell me "Agile is just something the developers do to make their lives easier." That is true, but only if we put the very narrow lens of a tactical improvement in place. Over time, we were able to help this stakeholder feel that they were on the same team as us, working toward the same goal, and that bigger bets and a culture of learning actually produced much better results. But it took a long time to build that trust, because that stakeholder had something to lose when they reported to their management. The more we can do to encourage experimenting with different approaches, the better. 

## If you're not considering culture, you've already lost

A slightly faster canoe is nothing compared to getting everyone to row together.
