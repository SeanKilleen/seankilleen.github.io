2024 felt like way too much all at once, for almost the entirety of the year. These are in no particular order.

* Our 4yo was diagnosed with early onset IBD, likely Crohn's. This came on in April and wasn't diagnosed until over 6 months later. In the interim, it was a very difficult time for him, filled with pain and uncertainty about his body. He adapted -- kids are so incredibly adaptable -- but it was either a low him or a blaring alarm in the background of the year for all of us.
* We had a really unfortunate experience with a Pre-K institution who claimed to support the whole child but failed us spectacularly on that front. So, we also had to part ways with a school, leaving us uncertain about where we'll enroll our guy in the new year.
* My car died. I had a 2013 BMW 3 series with only 80k miles. The transmission went, which it had no right to do. ðŸ˜† I loved that car, but I wasn't about to fork over that kind of money vs getting a new car. It served me well.
* Donald Trump somehow won the election. This will be bad for everyone, except for maybe Donald Trump. These are good days for bad people.
* Israel engaged in genocide, for roughly an entire year. It was on my mind a lot. It's devastating, and a generational shame that we collectively failed to stop it.
* I worked a lot. Too much. It was critical to do, but it often left both my wife and I exhausted which is no good for anyone.
* Because of all of the above, I let almost all social relationships lapse. If you're somehow reading this, it's absolutely not you, it's me. Hoping to patch it up in the coming year.

Despite all of this, there were bright spots.

* While work was hard, it was also the best year of work I've ever done. I built an amazing team, 
* The flip side of a car dying is that there's a new car. We got a 2025 Honda Accord Touring edition. It's a hybrid but still fun enough to drive that I don't miss the BMW. It has all the gadgets and bells and whistles that I could possibly want. I can warm it up from my phone. The touchscreen is huge. Love it so far.
