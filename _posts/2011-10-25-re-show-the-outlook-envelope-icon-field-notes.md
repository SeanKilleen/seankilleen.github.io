### Problem
I hid the Outlook envelope by accident, thinking it was temporary. Of course, it isn't. D'oh.

### Solution
To get it back:

* `Tools Menu > Options`
* Click the `E-Mail Options` button.
* Click the `Advanced E-Mail Options` button.
* In the `When new items arrive in my Inbox` section, check the `Show an envelope icon in the notification area` checkbox.
* Click okay to confirm the various options screens and you'll be back in business.
