Microsoft was kind enough to [feature me in a Microsoft Learn Contributor Story](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-developer-community/contributor-stories-sean-killeen/ba-p/4170139)!

This came about because Microsoft employee Randolph West nominated me. They appreciated the work I had done on finding some typos in the SQL Server documentation.

I think this is a great example of how even little things[^1] can make an impact, and how contributing to OSS isn't just code.

It went down like this:

* Randolph asked if anyone has noticed any typos in the SQL server documentation.
* I realized that the docs are OSS, so I could create a fork and run `cSpell` on them. So I did that.
* I found 54 inconsistencies affecting 31 articles, and was able to pass them on.

This made the impact that Randolph was looking for, and they were happy enough with that impact to nominate me, which came as a very pleasant surprise.

Don't forget that small contributions can still make an impact, and that OSS isn't just code.
