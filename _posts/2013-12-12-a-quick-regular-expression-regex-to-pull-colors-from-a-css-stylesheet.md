This one's mostly for my quick personal reference. It wasn't hard by any means but figured someone else might find it useful.

### Problem

I need to find all hex color codes in a style sheet so I can extract them.

### Solution

I came up with a quick Regex (regular expression) to do this:

```regex
    #([A-Fa-f0-9]*);
```

Essentially, it just looks for a pound symbol (`#`), followed by any amount of numbers 0-9 or letters a-f, followed by a semi-colon.

If you're interested to try it, you can view [my example over at Regex Tester].

It's not the slickest but it got the job done quickly.

Happy coding!
