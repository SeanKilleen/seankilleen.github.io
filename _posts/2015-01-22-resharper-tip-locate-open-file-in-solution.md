## Problem:

I found myself working in a giant mess of a solution and accidentally collapsed the solution. I needed to see where the current file I had open could be located in the solution.

## Solution

ReSharper to the rescue! One of my favorite tools.

In ReSharper, pressing `Shift` + `Alt` + `L` will expand the solution and locate your file.

Happy coding!
