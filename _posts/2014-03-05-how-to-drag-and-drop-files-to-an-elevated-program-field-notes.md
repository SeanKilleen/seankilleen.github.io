### Problem

I run Visual Studio as an Administrator, which is helpful, but also means that I can't drag &amp; drop files / folders from Windows Explorer (since it's not elevated). That's a pain in the butt.

### Solution

Thanks to [a handy discussion on the HowToGeek site][HTG Link], I found the following tip.

[Caveat: this [works on my machine][WOMM Link], a work desktop using Windows 7.]

#### To enable an elevated windows explorer:
* Right-click on the task bar and select `Start Task Manager`
* In Task Manager, select `File > New Task (Run...)`
* You should see a note that this will be run using administrative privileges. 

* Enter `explorer.exe` and hit enter.
You can now drag and drop files into other elevated windows with ease!
