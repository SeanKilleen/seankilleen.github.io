My take --
Attempting to embrace remote work, much like attempting to embrace agile principles, can expose many challenges in communication, leadership, and culture. The question is -- what does an org do with that information?
Remote work represents an opportunity for an organization to examine how it leads and engages its staff. If an organization is a distrustful, butts-in-seats org, that's not going to magically change with remote work. Hopefully, the flaw becomes more glaring, and leaders within the organization are able to point this out and work to improve it.
Otherwise, there will be many other organizations with remote opportunities that also include a culture of freedom and trust -- and the best employees will head there.
Leaders would be well-advised to use this shift in workplace to examine where they can improve their communication, engagement, and approaches. People will remember how organizations act in these times.
