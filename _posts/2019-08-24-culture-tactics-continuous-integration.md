_TODO: Insert the blurb about what this series is about._

## What a Tactical Approach to Continuous Integration Looks Like

* We have a build server
* Maybe our build server even runs tests 

## What a Cultural Approach Looks like

* We have tiny, short-lived branches.
* We don't need to have all of a "story" complete before we push.
* We get fast feedback -- from peers and tooling -- often as we work.
* We aren't afraid of showing our work early and often
* There is no "merge phase" or "integration phase"
* Any code we merge can go to production if it needs to
