### Problem

I was writing a Microsoft Word document and making use of cross-references, when I realized that upon changing the text/title of my cross reference, the links to that reference would not update their text. This led to me having to right-click each reference and choose "Update".

That was not going to fly.

### Solution

A quick Google revealed the solution to me:

`F9` is the magic key in Word to update cross-references, so selecting the entire document (via `CTRL + A`) and then pressing `F9` gets the job done.
