The [excellent folks over at Lifehacker have a tip] that seemingly works to resolve iPhone 4S and iOS 5 battery level issues.

The culprit? It looks to be a bug in the Time Zone settings that causes location services to go nuts and poll way more often than it needs to, draining the battery.

### Solution
To remedy the issue, according to Lifehacker:

>The solution for now seems to be manually switching off the automatic time zone updates located at Settings &rarr; Location Services -&gt; scroll to bottom to System Services &rarr; Setting Time Zone. Expect more conclusive results in the coming weeks.

I've tried it and saw an immediate and striking difference in battery life. Give it a shot if you haven't yet. And if you're jet-setting anytime soon, just re-enable it (or take me with you and I'll do it for you!)
