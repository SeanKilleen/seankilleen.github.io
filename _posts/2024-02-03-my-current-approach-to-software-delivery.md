As I prepare to onboard two new developers today (exciting!), part of the conversation will inevitably be about orienting them to my current philosophy of delivering software. I figured I'd share that here too.

## First, Caveats

I believe these sorts of things are context dependent. My current context is as a VP in a smaller organization who's leading multiple SaaS product efforts with a small team while building up our delivery acumen. And it's going well.

Some -- perhaps many -- of these notes may be widely held. I'm not claiming to have invented these things; I stand on the shoulders of giants.

## What is Innovation?

As VP of Innovation & Products, Innovation is right there in the title. What does that mean?

There are a lot of definitions that I like, but I've settled on my own language:

> Innovation is the act of continually looking at our opportunities and approach with fresh eyes in the pursuit of delight for our customers and colleagues.

## Software Delivery is a Team Sport 

Everyone should be able to:

* Take over their colleague's work in the case of something like an absence or shift in priorities. We keep each other informed of progress
* Ask for help or say they're stuck.
* Push a release confidently.
* Suggest a better approach
* Pair/mob as helpful to produce the results we need.

## Question Everything. Especially Me.

I depend on our collective insight. I have a vision and work to find alignment with our team, but we'll only ever be as good as the issues we surface and resolve.

## You are Not Your Code

I've written plenty of crap code. I've been lucky enough for people to provide great reviews and level me up. That's what I want for everyone.

It's good to remember that anyone can teach, anyone can learn, and we need ourselves to be critical of each others' code so we can get better. That requires us to he humble about our code, and to understand that our code is not the measure of our worth as developers

## Shitty First Drafts

Get something out there and iterate on it. Don't try to make it perfect. There is a cost to the delay. Shitty first drafts win every time.

I've re-learned this lesson a lot of times. I'll probably keep reloading it.

## Feedback is a Gift.

## The 30 Minute Rule

## Work Out Loud

## Asynchronous Communication

## Live Artifact Collaboration

## Unblock Others First. That's My Job, too.

## Doing the Best Work of Your Life is Not 9-5

## Smaller Loops. No, Smaller Than That.

## Automated Testing

It's an important tool in the toolbox. Where it helps us move faster and with confidence, we should do it. That is probably more places than we think. I love TDD and the way it forces me to break problems down. But mandating the practice of TDD across all code or automation for its own sake isn't helpful.

## Deliver as close to continuously as possible 

## Metrics are for information, not for judgment

## The Prime Directive

## Improving the Work is More Important Than Doing the Work

At least slightly.
