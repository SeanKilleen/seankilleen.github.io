As I prepare to onboard two new developers today (exciting!), part of the conversation will inevitably be about orienting them to my current philosophy of delivering software. I figured I'd share that here too.

## First, Caveats

I believe these sorts of things are context dependent. My current context is as a VP in a smaller organization who's leading multiple SaaS product efforts with a small team while building up our delivery acumen. And it's going well.

Some -- perhaps many -- of these notes may be widely held. I'm not claiming to have invented these things; I stand on the shoulders of giants.

## Software is a Team Sport 

## Question Everything. Especially Me.

## Feedback is a Gift.

## The 30 Minute Rule

## Work Out Loud

## Asynchronous Communication

## Live Artifact Collaboration

## Unblock Others First. That's My Job, too.

## Doing the Best Work of Your Life is Not 9-5

## Smaller Loops. No, Smaller Than That.

## Automated Testing

It's an important tool in the toolbox. Where it helps us move faster and with confidence, we should do it. That is probably more places than we think. I love TDD and the way it forces me to break problems down. But mandating the practice of TDD across all code or automation for its own sake isn't helpful.

## Deliver as close to continuously as possible 

## Metrics are for information, not for judgment

## The Prime Directive

## Improving the Work is More Important Than Doing the Work

At least slightly.
