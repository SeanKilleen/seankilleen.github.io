### Problem:

Oftentimes I'd like to perform a task on the solution, but in Visual Studio solutions with only one project, the solution doesn't show by default.

### Solution

Thanks to [K. Scott Allen] in a [Pluralsight] video (unfortunately, I forget which one as I've been browsing around a lot), you can take the following steps to get VS to always show the solution:

* `Tools Menu > Options...`
* Expand the `Projects and Solutions` category
* Click `General`
* Check the `Always Show Solution` box.

And voila! A solution will always be there
