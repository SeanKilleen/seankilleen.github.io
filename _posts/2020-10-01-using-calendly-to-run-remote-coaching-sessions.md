* Create a form for feedback (I used forms.office.com/) 
* Generate a link for the feedback form
* I synced my employer and my client calendars (ensured that both time slots were blocked off). This was a bit of manual effort, but worth it.
* I used calendly
* Set up meetings for various time lengths (15,30,45,60,90 minutes)

For each meeting:

* I set a time range of when people could book the meeting
* I set the meeting increments in 15 minute chunks
* I set that there should be a break between meetings of 15 minutes (for notes, bathroom breaks, etc.)
* On the invitation form, I ask for their name and e-mail. 
* I set an e-mail follow-up 1 hour after the meeting

Hi {{invitee_first_name}},

Thank you for attending {{event_name}} at {{event_time}} on {{event_date}}.

I'd love your feedback! Please see [TODO: the link] for a brief, anonymous feedback survey. You can also respond to this e-mail and provide me your feedback directly.

Also, don't forget to schedule your next sessions at: https://calendly.com/[my link]. 
You can schedule several sessions in advance before dates fill up. Be sure to use up our allotted time by [Date]!

Thanks,

Sean

PS sorry that this is automated; I normally prefer to do these in a more personal way but the volume of meetings prohibits that at this time.

I could also use the invite checklist to ask the coachee to provide a number of topics, but we did that within the space of the meeting
