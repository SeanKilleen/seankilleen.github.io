It's Valentine's Day! I'm grateful for all the love I've got in my life. Today also marks 6 months since I started at [SCT Software](https://sctsoftware.com) as Vice President of Innovation & Products. That represented a big move for me -- becoming responsible for leading an emerging engineering organization.

I'm a big believer in [keeping a "good stuff" list]({% 2018-12-29-you-should-keep-a-good-stuff-list %}). My experience so far has felt phenomenal, and I figured I should take my own advice and take stock here.

Below are some of the highlights of the past 6 months. I'll try to lump things together into some general categories.

## What's Next?

I feel like I'm doing some of the best work of my career, and I can't wait to see what will happen in the next 6 months. I'm optimistic.
