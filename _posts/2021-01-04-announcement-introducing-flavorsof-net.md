I'd received more than a few questions about the naming and differences between .NET Framework, .NET Core, .NET 5, Mono, Xamarin, etc.

So I decided to put up a small one-pager at <https://flavorsof.net>.

I'll polish it up a bit soon but wanted to post it here in case you can benefit from it.

Cheers!
