### Technology Involved

* Win7 Pro x64
* VirtualBox 4.1.x
* CentOS 5.x

### Problem:

When attempting to install a CentOS Guest VM from a VirtualBox Win7 x64 host, the installation appears to hang shortly after beginning.

The last line of text on the screen is:
> NET: Registered protocol family 2

### Solution

Per [this thread] (referencing an older version of VirtualBox but still relevant), the fix is as follows:

* Go into the settings of the VM
* Click the `System` section.
* Check `Enable IO APIC`.
* Save the settings.

When you start the install again, it will proceed normally.
