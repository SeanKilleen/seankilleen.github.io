The Intel RST Community Forum is a tough club to get into!

First, I try to login and LastPass helpfully fills in my saved information which I've used previously.  However, it appears it no longer works:

![Intel RST Account password not working]({{site.post-images}}/2014_01_21_06_33_21_Intel_Login.png)

No worry, I'll reset my password:

![New password emailed notification]({{site.post-images}}/2014_01_21_06_34_03_New_Password_e_mailed.png)

...just kidding. No e-mail ever arrives. Maybe I forgot to create my account:

![Account already exists]({{site.post-images}}/2014_01_21_06_32_20_Register_for_Intel_Communities.png)

And the kicker: Maybe I'm getting my username wrong and I can have them e-mail it to me...

Not really sure what else I can legitimately do to try to get into this web site..

Bonus! I found out that the Intel &amp; Intel Communities logins are different. OK, could have been my bad. I see the button to link the accounts:

![button to link the accounts]({{site.post-images}}/2014_01_21_06_57_34_Intel_Communities.png)

I previously just created an intel account to get around this mess, so this seems like the perfect solution! I click "login with my Intel account" and...

![Page not found error]({{site.post-images}}/2014_01_21_06_57_55_The_page_can_t_be_found_404_.png)

...I give up. Intel is just trolling me at this point.
