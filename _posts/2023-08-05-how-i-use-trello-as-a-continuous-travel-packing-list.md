We recently got back from a big trip, and that reminded me I've been meaning to publish a tip on how [Trello](https://trello.com) has saved me a lot of time and hassle around travel -- and how to set it up so that it can benefit you as well. I'm a big fan of kanban boards in general but this may have helped me more than any other.

## Why a "Continuous" Packing List?

In short? Because I used to forget stuff. _All the time_. By creating a continuous packing list that I reset for every trip, I could continue to add items that I'd forget and then never forget them again. This has a great deal of appeal for me.

My wife and I also may need to do some asynchronous planning / packing, especially with our little guy running around, and so the list is especially helpful when one of us thinks of something in the moment.

## The Setup

### Columns 

I have board columns for (in order):

* Uncommon Items
* Departure Checklist
* Master List
* Pack/Do
* Staged
* Done

#### Labels

I use labels to track categories, which I apply to a given item. I currently use the following labels (and apply multiple if needed):

* Clothing
* Electronics
* Toiletries
* Kid Stuff
* Containers/Staging
* Food
* Departure Checklist (this is something we need to do prior to leaving)

#### Automation

I have some Trello automation that moves items back into their respective lists (for when I return from a trip), and that sorts the items in a given list since I tend to pack one kind of thing at a time.

## How We Use It
