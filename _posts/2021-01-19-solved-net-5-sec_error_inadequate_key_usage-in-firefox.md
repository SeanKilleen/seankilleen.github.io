Ran across an issue I had to fix where a .NET 5 application, which happened to be running in a Docker container (this ended up being irrelevant), couldn't start up in Firefox due to a certificate error, even though I'd accepted the .NET certificate at the root. I saw a `SEC_ERROR_INADEQUATE_KEY_USAGE` error in the browser.

## Solution

This is because Firefox is not utilizing the Windows certificate store, so I have to force it to do so.

* Open the Firefox settings by going to `about:config`
* Search for `security.enterprise_roots.enabled`
* Ensure that the setting is set to `true`.

This will tell Firefox to use the Windows Cert store, which allows the certificate to be seen and the site trusted for local development.
