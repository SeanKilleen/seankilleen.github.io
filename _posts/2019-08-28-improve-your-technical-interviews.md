I'm often frustrated by the conversation I see around technical interviews. To combat this, I have a certain approach I’ve cultivated over the years. I'm attempting to write that down here, both to get feedback and to see if it resonates.

## Why I'm Writing This

* I've gotten very positive feedback from multiple interviewees on the interviews I've conducted -- both those that we've moved forward with and those that we haven't. 
* I feel like I've hired some really great people who've gone on to do great things as colleagues.
* I see a lot of discussion around interviews that either argue against these points, or touch on some of them in isolation. It seems that folks might benefit from seeing thoughts on the whole process ne place.

## What are the goals of a technical interview?

If a technical interview goes well, you’ll have a new teammate who can contribute to both your code and your team/org culture.

I would argue that an additional goal of a technical interview is to ensure that the team doesn’t move backwards in any significant way. By this, I mean that if you don’t optimize for the whole experience of your team, you could wind up with someone who improves your codebase but at the cost of demoralizing your whole team.

## Your Overall Approach

* **You should be rooting for the interviewee**. You should want them to succeed. There is no point to running your interview process like a gauntlet that someone has to get through. That’s just hazing. You should believe that this person has the potential to add something to your team. If you don’t, don’t schedule the interview, or figure out a less costly way to determine that.
* **You are showcasing your company's values**. You should be introducing them to your org's culture by living it. You want to make sure the employee thinks they’ll have a great environment. What better way to do that than to...give them a great environment from the interview onward?

## Think: what kind of person are you looking for?

I think this often informs the process incorrectly so many times because companies think they're looking for a certain type of person. This not only comes with its own bias which is an issue, but it also sets up the interview process to unsuccessfully weed out good candidates.

> We're looking for someone who can code. 

Is that all? My guess is you're looking for someone who can learn.

> We need someone to be productive.

You probably also need someone to be collaborative, and to be productive long-term.

> We need someone to fit.

This is where a lot of bias creeps in. You want someone to _add_ to your culture; you don't want someone to only conform to it.

## Preparing for the Interview

I firmly believe that a successful interview is based on the preparation the interviewer is able to do. Some of my ground rules include:

* Allow time to prep.
* Study the resume and the candidate.
* Come up with open-ended questions that go beyond the standard
* Find areas you need to dig deeper, and come up with questions for that
* Add these questions / concerns / etc. to a cheat sheet so that you can use it in the interview

More information on this below.

## Studying the Resume

I look at:

* The way they describe impact they make. Do they appear to grasp that their software matters to real people and stakeholders?
* Whether the resume is buzzword-heavy. 
* If there are many short-term work engagements or large gaps.
* Is there anything I feel the need to challenge? A listed achievement or piece of experience that seems worth confirming or exploring?
* Do they take individual credit for what really seems like a team activity? 
* Or conversely, do they not mention their involvement in large accomplishments at all?
* What don't they list that I might be concerned about them not walking in with (a critical technology, a conceptual understanding, etc.)

**There's an important next step: countering bias in these cases**. Does someone have a lot of short-term work? That doesn't necessarily mean anything; it could mean they worked for a staffing firm and were asked to move around a lot, or that they sought out short-term gigs for a period of time. There are many good reasons for someone to have a large gap, including caring for a loved one, raising a child, illness, etc. 

The key is to think in order to process those findings correctly. I've developed a process that I think works for me, at least personally. I'll talk about it below.

**Don't forget the positives!** **I also look for**:

* Awesome things they've accomplished that we could really utilize
* What they might bring to our environment / culture that we don't already have
* Any technology experience that could round out our overall capabilities.
* Any leadership or core skills -- mentoring, teaching, facilitating, presenting, writing.

## Findings --> Concerns --> Questions --> Conversation

OK, so say I've made some notes or seen some "flags" on a resume, and I want to address them but in a way that is truly open and keeps me rooting for the interviewee. 

* I note my **findings** while reading through the resume. I encourage myself to be critical, and I don't hold back. I'm picky even.
* I take a step back, and I think about what **concerns** these findings give me, or what areas I need to follow up on / challenge / explore further.
* At this point, my findings are no longer relevant. I am only considering the concerns I've surfaced. Oftentimes, I disregard some of my findings as unhelpful, because they aren't tied to a real concern that I can express.
* I create **open-ended questions** based on these concerns to explore things further. 
* In the interview, we **have a conversation** around these questions, where I am rooting for someone and genuinely trying to get to know them.

I have found that this allows me to explore concerns I might have while providing someone space to speak about them in an open way, which usually tells me if a concern is actually a concern. 

How does this work in practice? I'll take one (potentially problematic) example: a number of short-term jobs in someone's recent work history.

* **Finding**: "Uh-oh, I see a lot of short-term gigs here. That looks like a red flag. Did they not work out? Is there a persistent issue with this person? Are they job hopping and only looking to use us as a stepping stone rather than committing?" (remember: this is the spot where I allow myself to be human with biases, concerns, and not much of a filter).
* **Concern**: What's the actual concern here? We're looking for folks to grow with our company, and I need someone who is going to stick around and embrace our company, at least in good faith at first assuming that it stays mutually beneficial.
* **Questions**: OK, how can I help someone explore that topic in a way that will address my potential concerns. Maybe some questions would be:
  * "What do you look for in a long-term fit with a company?"
  * "What is an ideal day-to-day experience like?" 
  * "When have you felt best when working with a team?" 
  * "What do you think keeps you engaged when working somewhere?" 
* **Conversation**: Potential results could be: 
  * Oh, it turns out that this person is really looking for the kind of culture and experience we offer, but hadn't found it yet and was willing to keep moving. 
  * Oh, it turns out that this person really wants to affect change in ways that I'm completely on board with, but they kept hitting walls and knew they wouldn't be able to make a long-term impact.
  * Oh, this person took a gig with a staffing agency because they needed some specific flexibility but they're looking for a long-term fit now. That makes sense.
  * Oh, this person is really only looking for something short-term and weren't entirely clear on how we operate, but we were able to have a conversation around it.
  * Oh, this person really seems to be motivated by money, and they mentioned that they kept getting better offers and jumping ship. This tells me that our potential offer might not be compelling, and also that they don't appear to be ready to put down roots somewhere for a bit. There's nothing wrong with money, but this might not be the right person to invest in on-boarding at this time, especially if other aspects don't line up.

## The Importance of Open-Ended Questions

I could probably do a separate post on this alone (and I might).

If I'm looking for a colleague that I can collaborate with, I want to know that I can have a conversation with them, and that they will not expect to be a lone wolf developer in a basement somewhere. I think that conversation is key to that. You learn a lot about a person's capabilities, personality, values, and expectations when you give them space to tell you. 

* Am I concerned about someone's depth on a concept? I might ask them to apply to a certain problem or situation.
* Am I concerned that they appear to be a lone wolf? I might ask them what makes a great team, or what it means to them to be a leader. 
* Am I concerned that someone has very narrow experience? I may ask what technology interests them, what new things they're excited about, or how they keep their skills up to date to understand what's coming in the future. 

**Write down these questions ahead of time**, and try to get them in a rough order. This way you don't word them poorly when you ask them, and you have a sort of structure to the conversation.

## Structuring the Interview

* Preparation is key. Your ability to manage time and ask appropriate questions. 
* Pitch your company first. Why do you like it? Help them understand why it's a great place to work, in ways that are relevant to them. Allow for some questions up front.
* Confirm how long you have them for. This lets you know if you have a little extra room for questions. 
* Leave enough time for questions at the end.

## The Actual Interview

* Just before heading in, remember what it's like to interview. The dread, the lingering feeling afterward on whether you did well, the self-doubt, the headspace you're in, the  muscle memory folks have from past environments and cultures. Remember that no matter what, you want this person to tell other people how good this company would be to work for. Remember that you want them to succeed. Now, you are ready to head into the room.
* Make sure they feel comfortable. Ask them if they want a drink of water.
* Let them know this is more of a conversation than a quiz, and that you will be sure to leave room for questions.
* Let them know the agenda. This allows them to have expectations, and to mentally prepare for what will come after them. 
* Also, let them know what **won't** be on the agenda. Will you not be running a coding exam? Let them know that (and likely listen to that huge, sweet sigh of relief.)
* Are you taking notes? Let them know it's just to write down what they said, not to cast judgment in real time.
* Start off with a "recent win". Is there anything -- preferably professional, but outside of work is acceptable -- lately that someone feels is a "win" for them? I like this because people seem to immediately relax. They can talk about something they know from experience, and it kicks the interview off on a positive note. It also tells me something about what the interviewee values and why, and what they consider to be a positive impact in their lives.

## My Opinions on Certain Interview Practices

These are my personal opinions with some reasoning behind them.

### Should candidates code during the interview?

I say: No. If I am able, through conversation, to determine that this person has the fundamentals both conceptually and in terms of being a colleague, and is an open-minded, collaborative person that wants to improve, I usually don't need to watch them code. Everyone has different styles, and I expect us all to be learning together anyway.

### To whiteboard or not to whiteboard?

I believe white-boarding for conceptual / architectural explanations is a helpful tool. It helps me see how a person uses that space to see and explain things, like how they would potentially approach a problem. 

I have not found that I get much out of code in whiteboard format. It will at best be pseudo-code, and to expect more than that is unfair in my opinion.

### Should I push the interviewees buttons to see how they respond?

Absolutely not. Would you do this to them in the real world? I should certainly hope not. If a client or coworker were to do this in some situation and someone handled it poorly, hopefully you'd be mentoring and coaching someone on how to improve, and also advocating for them in an instance where someone was treating them poorly.

### We'll be doing coding; should they use Google?

If you ask someone to code, I'd suggest that you should treat it like you're pairing with a teammate. 

* It should be collaborative
* Tooling and resources should be available
* They should be able to use the machine / development environment of their choice

Otherwise, what's the point? Pretending that devs don't use tools or Google things just shows an interviewee that the exercise is pointless.

### What about having the candidate solve FizzBuzz?

If you're bringing someone into a technical interview and don't know whether or not they'd pass a problem like FizzBuzz, I think that's the real problem. 

Shift that process to the left and answer those questions earlier on. Ask a few screening questions. Run a small coding exam with something like coderpad.io, but don't make it something so overdone. Put a little thought in. Be creative and clear.

### We came up with a pretty intricate problem we're proud of. We think it'll be a good litmus test.

Great. You should ask everyone on your team -- particularly less senior developers -- to complete that problem. And then you should adjust that problem based on what you will inevitably learn. And then you should think about how cloudy someone's brain is when they feel under pressure, 

### Should I have someone balance a B-tree, do factorial calculations, etc.?

Only if someone on your team has had to do something similar to that in the past year. 

Otherwise you're optimizing for the wrong-thing. I don't need an algorithm wiz to write a great line-of-business app; I need someone who cares about a domain, collaborates with stakeholders, and is invested in improving as they go.

If you ask how someone would implement a fast-sorting algorithm and their answer is "first, I'd understand what we're trying to optimize for, and then I'd open Google and research about different types of sorting algorithms" -- I'd say that's a solid answer. 

### Should We use HackerRank, etc.?

No. (TODO: why)

### I can't really tell so much from conversation as what you're expecting. Is that a problem?

I'd say yes. If you can't have a conversation and determine whether this is the sort of person who will make the impact you need at your team / company, I would argue that you may not be the best person to give the interview.

### What about half-day / whole day interviews?

My opinion:

* If you’re scheduling a long interview because everyone needs to take a turn with an interviewee, I would argue that your interview process may be broken. Figure out who are the people to trust, and make the interview with them. At my current company we’ve had fantastic success with a 1-1.5 hour interview with two folks from a practice area, and a 30 minute conversation with one of our executives.
* If you bring someone in for a half day technical interview, it should be to work on a real style problem in a pairing or team setting, as close to an actual work day setup as possible. They should have access to tools, google, OSS, etc. during the process.
* If you’re having someone join an actual team for a half or full day session to work on actual client or product work, you need to compensate them for their time. Agree on an hourly rate that shows someone you respect their time and effort. Pay them for their time even if the interview ends early. Are you worried they’ll only last an hour? Do more prep and screening work up front.
