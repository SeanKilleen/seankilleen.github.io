I'm writing this up because I'm frustrated by so much of the conversation I tend to see around it. I have a certain philosophy I've developed and I'm attempting to write that down here, both to get feedback and to see if it resonates.

## Interviews Work Both Ways

## What are the goals of a technical interview?

## Your Overall Approach

* You should be rooting for the interviewee. You should want them to succeed.
* You should be introducing them to your org's culture
* You are -- whether you realize it or not -- showcasing your company's values.

## Thinks: what kind of person are you looking for?

I think this often informs the process incorrectly so many times because companies think they're looking for a certain type of person. This not only comes with its own bias which is an issue, but it also sets up the interview process to unsuccessfully weed out good candidates.

> We're looking for someone who can code. 

Is that all? My guess is you're looking for someone who can learn.

> We need someone to be productive.

You probably also need someone to be collaborative.

> We need someone to fit.

This is where a lot of bias creeps in. You want someone to _add_ to your culture; you don't want someone to only conform to it. 

## Preparing for the Interview

* Allow time to prep.
* Study the resume and the candidate.
* Come up with open-ended questions that go beyond the standard
* Find areas you need to dig deeper, and come up with questions for that
* Add these questions / concerns / etc. to a cheat sheet so that you can use it in the interview

## Structuring the Interview

* Preparation is key. Your ability to manage time and ask appropriate questions. 
* Pitch your company first. Why do you like it? Help them understand why it's a great place to work, in ways that are relevant to them. Allow for some questions up front.
* Confirm how long you have them for. This lets you know if you have a little extra room for questions. 
* Leave enough time for questions at the end.

## The Actual Interview

* Just before heading in, remember what it's like to interview. The terror, the dread, the lingering feeling afterward on whether you did well. Remember that no matter what, you want this person to tell other people how good this company would be to work for. Remember that you want them to succeed. Now, you are ready to head into the room.
* Make sure they feel comfortable. Ask them for a drink of water.
* Let them know this is more of a conversation than a quiz.
* Are you taking notes? Let them know it's just to write down what they said, not to cast judgment in real time.

## Should candidates code during the interview?

I say: No. If I am able, through conversation, to determine that this person has the fundamentals both conceptually and in terms of being a colleague, and is an open-minded, collaborative person that wants to improve, I usually don't need to watch them code. Everyone has different styles, and I expect us all to be learning together anyway.

## To whiteboard or not to whiteboard?

I believe white-boarding for conceptual / architectural explanations is a helpful tool. It helps me see how a person uses that space to see and explain things, like how they would potentially approach a problem.
