I'm writing this up because I'm frustrated by so much of the conversation I tend to see around it. I have a certain philosophy I've developed and I'm attempting to write that down here, both to get feedback and to see if it resonates.

## Why I'm Writing This

* I've gotten very positive feedback from multiple interviewees on the interviews I've conducted -- both those that we've moved forward with and those that we haven't. 
* I feel like I've hired some really great people who've gone on to do great things as colleagues.

## Interviews Work Both Ways

## What are the goals of a technical interview?

## Your Overall Approach

* You should be rooting for the interviewee. You should want them to succeed.
* You should be introducing them to your org's culture
* You are -- whether you realize it or not -- showcasing your company's values.

## Thinks: what kind of person are you looking for?

I think this often informs the process incorrectly so many times because companies think they're looking for a certain type of person. This not only comes with its own bias which is an issue, but it also sets up the interview process to unsuccessfully weed out good candidates.

> We're looking for someone who can code. 

Is that all? My guess is you're looking for someone who can learn.

> We need someone to be productive.

You probably also need someone to be collaborative.

> We need someone to fit.

This is where a lot of bias creeps in. You want someone to _add_ to your culture; you don't want someone to only conform to it. 

## Preparing for the Interview

* Allow time to prep.
* Study the resume and the candidate.
* Come up with open-ended questions that go beyond the standard
* Find areas you need to dig deeper, and come up with questions for that
* Add these questions / concerns / etc. to a cheat sheet so that you can use it in the interview

## Studying the Resume

I look at:

* The way they describe impact
* Whether the resume is buzzword-heavy
* If there are many short-term work engagements or large gaps.
* Is there anything I feel the need to challenge? A listed achievement or piece of experience that seems worth confirming or exploring?
* Do they take individual credit for what really seems like a team activity? 
* Or conversely, do they not mention their involvement in large accomplishments?
* What don't they list that I might be concerned about walking in with

There's an important next step: countering bias in these cases. Does someone have a lot of short-term work? That doesn't necessarily mean anything; it could mean they worked for a staffing firm and were asked to move around a lot, or that they sought out short-term gigs for a period of time. There are many good reasons for someone to have a large gap, including caring for a loved one, raising a child, illness, etc. 

The key is to think to process those findings correctly. I've developed a process that I think works for me, at least personally. I'll talk about it below.

Don't forget the positives! I also look for:

* Awesome things they've accomplished that we could really utilize
* What they might bring to our environment / culture that we don't already have
* Any technology experience that could round out our overall capabilities.

## Findings --> Concerns --> Questions --> Conversation

OK, so say I've made some notes or seen some "flags" on a resume, and I want to address them but in a way that is truly open and keeps me rooting for the interviewee. 

* I note my findings while reading through the resume. I encourage myself to be critical, and I don't hold back. I'm picky even.
* I take a step back, and I think about what concerns these findings give me, or what areas I need to follow up on / challenge / explore further.
* At this point, my findings are no longer relevant. I am only considering the concerns I've surfaced. Oftentimes, I disregard some of my findings as unhelpful, because they aren't tied to a real concern that I can express.
* I create open-ended questions based on these concerns to explore things further. 
* In the interview, we have a conversation around these questions, where I am rooting for someone and genuinely trying to get to know them.

I have found that this allows me to explore concerns I might have while providing someone space to speak about them in an open way, which usually tells me if a concern is actually a concern. 

## The Importance of Open-Ended Questions

I could probably do a separate post on this alone (and I might).

If I'm looking for a colleague that I can collaborate with, I want to know that I can have a conversation with them, and that they will not expect to be a lone wolf developer in a basement somewhere. I think that conversation is key to that. You learn a lot about a person's capabilities, personality, values, and expectations when you give them space to tell you. 

* Am I concerned about someone's depth on a concept? I might ask them to apply to a certain problem or situation.
* 

I can't stress this enough: write down these questions ahead of time. This way you don't word them poorly when you ask them, and you have a sort of structure to the conversation.

## Structuring the Interview

* Preparation is key. Your ability to manage time and ask appropriate questions. 
* Pitch your company first. Why do you like it? Help them understand why it's a great place to work, in ways that are relevant to them. Allow for some questions up front.
* Confirm how long you have them for. This lets you know if you have a little extra room for questions. 
* Leave enough time for questions at the end.

## The Actual Interview

* Just before heading in, remember what it's like to interview. The terror, the dread, the lingering feeling afterward on whether you did well. Remember that no matter what, you want this person to tell other people how good this company would be to work for. Remember that you want them to succeed. Now, you are ready to head into the room.
* Make sure they feel comfortable. Ask them for a drink of water.
* Let them know this is more of a conversation than a quiz.
* Are you taking notes? Let them know it's just to write down what they said, not to cast judgment in real time.
* Start off with a "recent win". Is there anything -- preferably professional, but outside of work is acceptable -- lately that someone feels is a "win" for them? I like this because people seem to immediately relax. They can talk about something they know from experience, and it kicks the interview off on a positive note. It also tells me something about what the interviewee values and why, and what they consider to be a positive impact in their lives.

## My Stances on Certain Interview Practices

### Should candidates code during the interview?

I say: No. If I am able, through conversation, to determine that this person has the fundamentals both conceptually and in terms of being a colleague, and is an open-minded, collaborative person that wants to improve, I usually don't need to watch them code. Everyone has different styles, and I expect us all to be learning together anyway.

### To whiteboard or not to whiteboard?

I believe white-boarding for conceptual / architectural explanations is a helpful tool. It helps me see how a person uses that space to see and explain things, like how they would potentially approach a problem. 

I have not found that I get much out of code in whiteboard format. It will at best be pseudo-code, and to expect more than that is unfair in my opinion.

### Should I push the interviewees buttons to see how they respond?

Absolutely not. Would you do this to them in the real world? I should certainly hope not. If a client or coworker were to do this in some situation and someone handled it poorly, hopefully you'd be mentoring and coaching someone on how to improve, and also advocating for them in an instance where someone was treating them poorly.
