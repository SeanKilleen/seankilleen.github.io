**Summary:** Are you a maintainer of, or large contributor to, an OSS project in .NET? Please [take the survey about how we can better support you.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMvnARfsQ6vgrgaRK-fzR80zXDKfAL2eJUhA_aD7EFjAX8ew/viewform?usp=sf_link)

I've long been passionate about the cause of supporting open source software in the .NET 
community -- and supporting those who give us their time, effort, and expertise to make this happen.

I've seen a lot of calls from various areas in the community asking how we can better support maintainers. As I've been thinking about my own impact map for how to encourage our community to support maintainers (more on that in a future post), one thing that's become clear is there are no good data points for how supported maintainers feel in various ways and how they'd like to be supported. How do we know we're making an impact if we're not measuring these things?

So, that's what I'm setting out to change. I've compiled the first edition of the .NET OSS Maintainer Support Survey. 

## Q & A

### Where can I find the survey?

The survey can be found at <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMvnARfsQ6vgrgaRK-fzR80zXDKfAL2eJUhA_aD7EFjAX8ew/viewform?usp=sf_link>. 

I'm also embedding it at the bottom of this post. 

### Who Should Submit a Response?

Anyone who is a large contributor to or maintainer of an OSS project in .NET

### Who's running this survey?

Just me as an individual. [My employer](https://excella.com) is pretty awesome and supports me doing things like this.

### What will you do with the data?

* I'm going to aggregate it, anonymize it, and share it -- I hope that this data can inform our community's overall efforts.
*  I'll use the contact information, with respondents' permission, to follow up with them for more insight and attempt to include that.

### How can I help?

Forward this to your favorite maintainer. Don't spam their repository, but reach out to them. Let them know that you'd like their thoughts because it
