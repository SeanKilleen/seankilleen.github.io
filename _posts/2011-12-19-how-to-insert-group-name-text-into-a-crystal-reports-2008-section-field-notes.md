### Problem:

I accidentally deleted the group name text from a section of my Crystal Report in Crystal Reports 2008, and now I would like to re-insert the text.

### Solution

This is embarrassingly simple, and yet I found it to be surprisingly counter-intuitive. Maybe it's just me..

In the `Field Explorer` section, expand the `Group Name Fields` section and drag the name onto the report.

![Field Explorer Window]({{site.post-images}}/FieldExplorer_GroupName.png)

It's not under insert, not as a menu shortcut, etc. -- as far as I can tell, the only place to drag a Group Name field from is there.
