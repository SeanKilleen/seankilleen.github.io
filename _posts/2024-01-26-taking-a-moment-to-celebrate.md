As of today, I've been in my current role as VP of Innovation & Products at SCT for 6 months. I think that's a nice chunk of time, and I wanted to take some space to reflect on what I[^1] have been able to accomplish, because I feel like I've been doing some of the best work of my life and I don't want to forget this moment. Since [I advocate for keeping a "Good Stuff" list](https://seankilleen.com/2018/12/you-should-keep-a-good-stuff-list/), I thought I'd share some of mine here.

## Infrastructure

* Established CI/CD pipeline
* Established Deployment in SAP BTP CloudFoundry infrastructure
* Moved our entire infrastructure to Kubernetes via SAP BTP Kyma.
* Moved infrastructure to being deployed via Terraform

## Architecture 

* Introduced and implemented the actor model via Akka.NET after understanding & validating the need for reactivity in one of our applications.

## Process

* Introduced and on-boarded the team to GitHub Flow
* Began lean daily stand-ups

## Leadership

* [Created & automated a hiring process](TODO: Blog link)
* On-boarded 2 new developers

[^1]: Obviously, nobody does these things alone, but I like to capture where I've had a major hand, and it's easier as a convention to say "I".
