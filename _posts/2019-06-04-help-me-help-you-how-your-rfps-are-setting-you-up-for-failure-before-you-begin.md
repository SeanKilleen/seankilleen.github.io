TODO: Intro.

Examples:

* An RFP describing how we would fill an entire PMO office to do waterfall style development (we wouldn't).
* An RFP describing how we "turn static assets from the requirements and design phase into aesthetically pleasing web pages".
* Saying that work needs to be local with no remote work. How will you find the best talent? How can I export the best parts of my organization and culture if remote is ruled out from a contractual sense? Why don't I have the opportunity to pitch the ways in which remote work could be applied effectively and efficiently?
* So many assumptions about what appropriate development is.
* Giant RFPs requiring 100-person teams, vs experimenting at the contract level to try to change things a bit at a time.
* Requiring expertise in known outdated technologies (Flash?) rather than asking for a partner
* Companies want the results of consultants and partnerships, while setting themselves up to employ contractors who respond to direction.
* No clear metrics for success in the RFP. I've seen "lack of customer complaints" defined as the only quality metric.
* Mandating that certain aspects of the RFP will become part of the final product. Really, the quality metrics table for reporting is going to never change, despite you wanting to change the way your applications are built and perceived? We're not going to learn anything between RFP and the end of this contract?
* Contracts leave very little room for learning. I wonder if we haven't appropriately figured out the legal way to say "we're going to set common goals, pursue them together, and learn things along the way". 
* Treating complex, complicated problems and situations as something that you can order a solution for from a vending machine.
