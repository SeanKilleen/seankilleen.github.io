Are you someone who has a hand in crafting Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for your company? This article is for you, ans is based off of some things I've seen lately that compel me to make some recommendations. 

Crafting an RFP for your proposal creates the entire universe for vendors to respond to, because part of submitting a proposal is brinh 

## RFPs are Important!

Crafting an RFP for your proposal limits the entire universe in which vendors can respond, because part of submitting a proposal is remaining compliant with the RFP for readability and scorability. So without crafting RFPs in a way that is conscious of this, you will get proposals that will not necessarily match the best result for your company, and you may be none the wiser about it. 

## Ways I've Seen RFP's go wrong

A brief, incomplete set of examples:

* **An RFP describing how we would fill an entire PMO office to do waterfall style development**. Answer: We likely wouldn't, as there's a lot of material pointing to that sort of setup being counter-productive and not conducive to fast learning and iterating.
* **An RFP describing how we "turn static assets from the requirements and design phase into aesthetically pleasing web pages"**. This sets us up, again, to think in a waterfall style. If we're assuming that a large portion of the delivery team won't be collaborative, we have to speak to that, even though we'd recommend against it. Having user research and human-centered design inform the effort from the outset will likely be much more effective.
* **Stressing the full completion of the work.** One of the underlying tenants of agile that I strong believe in is 
* Saying that work needs to be local with no remote work. How will you find the best talent? How can I export the best parts of my organization and culture if remote is ruled out from a contractual sense? Why don't I have the opportunity to pitch the ways in which remote work could be applied effectively and efficiently?
* So many assumptions about what appropriate development is.
* Giant RFPs requiring 100-person teams, vs experimenting at the contract level to try to change things a bit at a time.
* Requiring expertise in known outdated technologies (Flash?) rather than asking for a partner
* Companies want the results of consultants and partnerships, while setting themselves up to employ contractors who respond to direction.
* No clear metrics for success in the RFP. I've seen "lack of customer complaints" defined as the only quality metric.
* Mandating that certain aspects of the RFP will become part of the final product. Really, the quality metrics table for reporting is going to never change, despite you wanting to change the way your applications are built and perceived? We're not going to learn anything between RFP and the end of this contract?
* Contracts leave very little room for learning. I wonder if we haven't appropriately figured out the legal way to say "we're going to set common goals, pursue them together, and learn things along the way". 
* Treating complex, complicated problems and situations as something that you can order a solution for from a vending machine.

## You're Hiring Someone to Raise Your Consciousness. THAT's Your RFP. 

## So, what would I recommend the RFP?

* Start small
* Be up-front about how big you plan on going
* Use very few words to ask about process
* Use lots of words to talk about challenges and outcomes
* Talk about where you feel the need to be more cautious currently
* Be vulnerable. 

## ...But the best tip?

Get someone you trust involved up front. Do you have training partners, former consultants former employees who've helped you out? Involve them in your RFP process. This is important, and it could impact your culture and your outcomes for years into the future. Pull in the people you trust and get them to advise you on the things the RFP needs to say -- and more importantly, what it doesn't need to say.
