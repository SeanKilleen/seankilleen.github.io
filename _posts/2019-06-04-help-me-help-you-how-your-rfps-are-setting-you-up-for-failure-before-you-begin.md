Are you someone who has a hand in crafting Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for your company? This article is for you, ans is based off of some things I've seen lately that compel me to make some recommendations. 

*NOTE: Below, I say "us" a lot. This refers to a generic company model, and not my specific current employer.*

## RFPs are Important!

Crafting an RFP for your proposal limits the entire universe in which vendors can respond, because part of submitting a proposal is remaining compliant with the RFP for readability and scorability. So without crafting RFPs in a way that is conscious of this, you will get proposals that will not necessarily match the best result for your company, and you may be none the wiser about it. 

## Ways I've Seen RFP's go wrong

A brief, incomplete set of examples:

* **An RFP describing how we would fill an entire PMO office to do waterfall style development**. Answer: We likely wouldn't, as there's a lot of material pointing to that sort of setup being counter-productive and not conducive to fast learning and iterating.
* **An RFP describing how we "turn static assets from the requirements and design phase into aesthetically pleasing web pages"**. This sets us up, again, to think in a waterfall style. If we're assuming that a large portion of the delivery team won't be collaborative, we have to speak to that, even though we'd recommend against it. Having user research and human-centered design inform the effort from the outset will likely be much more effective.
* **Stressing the full completion of the work.** One of the underlying value propositions of agile development that I strongly believe in this: in a large effort, you will run out of time and/or money. In that case, you want to ensure that the most important things have been done as soon as possible, so that you are maximizing the value of your delivery along the way. RFPs that ask us to describe how we get to "fully done" are asking us to make up magic, which is not the sort of thing we want to do.
* **Specifying that work needs to be local with no remote work.** How will you find the best talent? How can I export the best parts of my organization and culture if remote work is already ruled out from a contractual sense? Why don't I have the opportunity to pitch the ways in which remote work could be applied effectively and efficiently? To specify a preference is totally reasonable -- jobs matter in local markets -- but to restrict the response in an RFP means we can't discuss it.  
* **Giant RFPs requiring 100-person teams**. The best efforts seek competent teams to orient toward a goal, learn along the way, and grow when there's good progress. Asking for a large team points to a large objective that we think is known, and "bodies" to fill that objective. Investment wise, it is smarter to attempt to connect with a partner who can help you learn quickly and grow along the way. Otherwise, you're inviting a lot of churn and organizational backlash, and I've yet to see a company that's actually prepared for a transformation with full organizational buy-in.
* **Requiring expertise in known outdated technologies (Flash, anyone?)** By requiring us to speak to expertise in outdated technologies, you're limiting the quality of candidates we can bring you, and are already into the solutioning space, when the problem is that you haven't moved beyond these technologies.
* **Wanting a consultant or partner, but specifying a contractor.** Companies want the results of consultants and partnerships, while setting themselves up to employ contractors who respond to direction. RFPs that require signing off on hiring of team members, or that indicate that the vendor will be performing work always at the direction of the client, set companies up for less than ideal results. You should want someone who moves you forward and teaches you as they go.
* **No clear metrics for success in the RFP**. I've seen "lack of customer complaints" defined as the only quality metric. If you don't have metrics for success, it's OK to ask for help defining them. If you allow the space for a company to tell you who they are rather than what they'll do, you'll get a sense for whether someone would be a good partner to help you come up with these metrics.
* **Mandating that certain aspects of the RFP will become part of the final product**. Really, the quality metrics table in the RFP is never going to change, despite you wanting to change the way your applications are built and perceived? We're not going to learn anything between RFP and the end of this contract?
* **Contracts leave very little room for learning.** I wonder if we haven't appropriately figured out the legal way to say "we're going to set common goals, pursue them together, and learn things along the way". 

## You're Hiring Someone to Raise Your Consciousness. THAT's Your RFP. 

## So, what would I recommend the RFP?

* Start small
* Be up-front about how big you plan on going
* Use very few words to ask about process
* Use lots of words to talk about challenges and outcomes
* Talk about where you feel the need to be more cautious currently
* Be vulnerable. 

## ...But the best tip?

Get someone you trust involved up front. Do you have training partners, former consultants former employees who've helped you out? Involve them in your RFP process. This is important, and it could impact your culture and your outcomes for years into the future. Pull in the people you trust and get them to advise you on the things the RFP needs to say -- and more importantly, what it doesn't need to say.
