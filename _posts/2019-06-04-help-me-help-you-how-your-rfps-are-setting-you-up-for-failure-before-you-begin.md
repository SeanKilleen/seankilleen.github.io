TODO: Intro.

Examples:

* An RFP describing how we would fill an entire PMO office to do waterfall style development (we wouldn't).
* An RFP describing how we "turn static assets from the requirements and design phase into aesthetically pleasing web pages".
* So many assumptions about what appropriate development is.
* Giant RFPs requiring 100-person teams, vs experimenting at the contract level to try to change things a bit at a time.
