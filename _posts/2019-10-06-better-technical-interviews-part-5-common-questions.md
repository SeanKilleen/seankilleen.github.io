## Before we begin: A warning

Please recall that throughout preceding articles, I mentioned that the interview process needs to be heavily tailored to the position you're seeking to fill, and to the research you've done on an interviewee.

I mention this again here because it's really important. If you treat the questions below as a one-size-fits-all playbook, you will be doing your team and your interviewees a disservice. There is no overall interview playbook in my opinion.

The goal of the questions below is to show the types of open-ended questions I might ask to give the candidate space to show and tell me who they are around certain topics. These questions rarely exist on their own, but I usually try to turn them into mini conversations. **The follow-up is key.**

With that said, here are some common questions I tend to ask and my reasoning behind them. 

## My Common Interview Questions, and their aims

### "Tell me about a recent win you've had. Could be work-related, but doesn't have to be."

* **When I ask this question:**
* **Why I ask this question:**
* **What sorts of answers do I look for:**

### With so much happening in this industry, how do you keep your skills up to date?

### What are some differences between mediocre and great teams? What are some things that great teams do?

### "Tell me about a recent win you've had. Could be work-related, but doesn't have to be."
### Do you know what SOLID principles are? If so, do you have opinions on where they're useful / not useful?
### What is the difference between inheritance and composition? 
### What are interfaces, and why are they useful? 
### What kind of automated tests have you worked with? 
### What is the difference between code first and database first? 
### If you had a large legacy application and needed to refactor a large part of the code base, how would you approach that? 
### What are some key characteristics of a good unit test? 
### What does it mean to be a leader?
### What are some key components of high performing teams in your view? 
### How would you mentor a junior developer who was more junior than you?
### Youâ€™re going to miss deadline, what do you do?
### What is your ideal day to day?
### Ideal process from requirement --> Production
