*Ed. Note: This is a post category I'm trying to start, as a form of public disclosure, listing items I bought at the grocery store, available publicly for your reference or critique.*

Alright, since this is the first one of these, I haven't quite figured out how I'm going to do it all the time. I'll likely scan my lists, but for now, I'll list the items.

I think this is an okay start:

* A green pepper &amp; a yellow pepper
* Sliced baby bella mushrooms (I'm lazy, sue me)
* 6  apples
* Dozen eggs
* An onion
* A tomato
* 1/2 Gallon Fat-Free Milk
* Crumbled Feta cheese
* Boatland Farms Strawberry / Banana Juice
* Celery Sticks
* Asparagus
* A Cucumber
* Garlic

#### My Plan

* Apples for Snacks
* Tonight: Orzo (package some up for lunch tomorrow with an apple, celery sticks, &amp; sliced pepper to snack on throughout the day)
* Tomorrow morning: Eggs and leftover tomato &amp; onion with garlic
* Tomorrow evening: Asparagus and mushrooms with chicken &amp; garlic (with planned leftovers for lunch)
* Glass of milk each morning

This is mainly my "keeping me honest" thing, but your thoughts &amp; suggestions are always welcome in the comments.
