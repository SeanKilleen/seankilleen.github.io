_Author's note: I assume I can't be the first one to come up with this, but I can't find references to something similar elsewhere. If you have similar examples, I'd love to see them! Please post them in the comments._

Outline:

* Commandments: You must do TDD! You must do blue/green deployments!
* These are often seen as a path to maturity
* There is no one-size-fits all path to maturity.

Instead, what if we frame it as:

> We are (confident/not confident) that _____________, because _______________.  

Example: endless debate about what kinds of automated testing are good / reasonable.

* We are confident that we can change code without breaking other code.
* We are confident that our software works as we think it does
* We are confident that our software works as our users expect it to (this is different from above).

## It's not maturity; it's a spectrum of confidence 

The position on that spectrum can change. "We were highly confident that our keys wouldn't be exposed, but then we realized our build system dumps environment variables into the logs and that's not great.

## Multiple paths from here

Confidence meters allow for multiple approaches and steps to improve confidence, and so they allow for divergent thinking rather than judgment against some ultimately flawed idea of "maturity".
