Every once in a while I'll Google for something relatively straightforward to see if there's a better way to do it.

Today, that was finding the startup folder with Windows 8.1 -- and I'm glad I looked!

I found an excellent Microsoft KB Article (unfortunately I lost the link). Apparently, you can just open a run dialog and type `shell:startup`:

...and voila! The startup menu is there.

A lot easier than remembering `C:\Users\Sean\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`, if I do say so.

I did some more digging and found [a great post on PeteNetLive][Post Link] that goes through some of the other shortcuts that exist as well.

And the potential exists for more! Per the article, you just have to open `regedit.exe` and navigate to `HKLM > Software > Microsoft > Windows > CurrentVersion > Explorer > FolderDescriptions`. In there is a menu with all of the GUIDs. Look at the `Name` property for the thing you'd have to type. I see a few interesting ones on mine, though your mileage may vary.
