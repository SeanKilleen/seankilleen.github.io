I can't believe I hadn't come across this yet! Posting in case you can benefit from it, too.

## Challenge

On Windows, I often need to open a taskbar app as an admin, such as Powershell or Windows Terminal.

I thought my options were limited to:

* Right-click the icon, (and in the case of windows terminal, right-click again), and select "Run as Administrator".
* Set the app to always run as an administrator via the security settings in the shortcut -- not something I love doing from a security standpoint, and not an option with Windows Terminal to my knowledge.

## Solution: A Keyboard Shortcut!

I had no idea about this and I absolutely love it.

You can use `Win` + `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `[Position number]` to open a pinned taskbar app as an admin.

For example, I have the windows terminal pinned as the farthest left icon on my taskbar. `Win + Ctrl + Shift + 1` opens it as an admin.

## Bonus: Another Thing I'd Apparently Missed

You can also hold `Ctrl + Shift` and then click the icon to start it in admin mode. I feel more productive already.

Happy elevating!
