## Problem
I love ReSharper, but it comes with some performance implications, and sometimes I need it to go away for a few minutes, particularly when I'm working with a large codebase.

## Solution
You can create a keyboard shortcut to toggle ReSharper.

* Open Visual Studio
* Head to `Tools` --> `Options` --> `Keyboard`
* Set shortcut for `ReSharper_ToggleSuspended` (you can search for it in the menu)
  * I used `CTRL` + `ALT` + `R`

Now, you should be able to toggle ReSharper whenever you need to.

Happy coding!
