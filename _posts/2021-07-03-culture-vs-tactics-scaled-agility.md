* Scaling down the work is the more important part
* Scaled frameworks lull organizations into a sense of false security
* not having to change much seen as an advantage
* Change is hard; a culture that dives into it will succeed. Scaled agile frameworks are 99% of the time an excuse to avoid it.
* Link to the scaling manifesto, which I'm still proud of despite not authoring.
