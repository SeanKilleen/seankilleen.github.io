FYI, there are some changes coming that may impact this blog's RSS feeds.

If you were using `atom.xml` or `rss.xml`, those feeds are going away in favor of `feed.xml`.

Basically, there will likely be another post shortly -- within a day or two, max. If you don't see that, please re-add this site to your RSS reader, which should then pick up on `feed.xml`.

Thanks, and sorry for any inconvenience!
