I got a surprising amount of positive feedback on a job description I wrote recently, both internally and from candidates. So, I figured I'd write up my process here in case it can help anyone.

**Caveat up front**: There are lots of ways to do this well; this is just one way that happened to work without a ton of effort on my part.

## A Window Into Your Company's Culture

The job description is a way for you to live your company's culture. Use That to your advantage. Does it reflect the values of your organization? Does it reflect the way you intend to show up as a leader? Think about key words and ideas that reflect your culture/value that you feel strongly about and work them into the post.

## The Art of Candidate Self-Selection

Job posts are a filter -- and that's okay!

I believe the key to a good job post is candidate self-selection. I want to inspire candidates who would be a great fit to self-select _into_ the role, and I want candidates who wouldn't be a fit to self-select _out_.

That means that a job post in a sense has to be performative -- it has to evoke a response in order to get candidates to do one of those two things.

In our case, here are some key phrases I used and the self-selection I hoped to get:

| Phrase | Impression |
| ------ | ---------- |
| "We are embarking on the next phase of our product offering" | sense of adventure and also unknown. |
| "We're also looking toward the future with an eye toward new products" | People looking to learn and build, and who are comfortable in emerging teams. |
| "We are operating on the cutting edge of our ecosystem. Our platform runs on .NET 8 (on the first day of its launch!)" | Staying current, learning together. |
| "We embrace and cultivate a culture of humble leadership and support. We thrive on input and collective ownership." | Team members will need to provide input; we want and need to be comfortable driving things forward. We will support each other. |
| "We take our work seriously, but also care about work/life balance." | It's not a 9-5 job; we need people to care about impact. We also have flexibility because we're more results-oriented than time-oriented. |
| "If this sounds like you, we encourage you to apply, even if you don't tick every box" | We care about helping people grow. Our goal isn't to just weed people out our "hire elite people". |
| "You don't mind a little bit of chaos. ðŸ˜…" | We need people who are comfortable in dynamic environments and are willing to help things grow. People who need well-established systems or lots of process will not do well here. |
| "You'll talk directly to the hiring manager" | We're a no-BS company. | 
| "Salary: Depends on experience. We'll make sure nobody's time gets wasted." | I had a decently large range on the salary, and I wanted people to know I was interested in paying what they're worth in our market, and I also didn't want to waste time doing a negotiation dance. |

Several applicants made reference to the description of "humble leadership" and "thriving on input". People also had great follow-up questions about the "chaos" that helped us further clarify and suss out a fit. Several were excited about the growth opportunities and were attracted to the idea of building new and emerging things.

## Sections of the Job Post

The structure of a job post also sends a message and is performative in its own way.

I like to structure a post as:

* About Us
* About You
* About This Role
* Where You'll Grow

## "About Us"

## "About You"


## "About the Role"

* I keep the list of skills and buzzwords low -- again, most of these things can be taught and I don't need great people self-filtering due to imposter syndrome. I try to keep it to "Day 1 skills" -- things I need people to be proficient in when they enter the organization.
* "If this sounds like you, we encourage you to apply, even if you donâ€™t tick every box. Itâ€™s okay to let us know where your strengths and weaknesses are on this list." -- anyone who takes me up on this gets a positive note for sure

## "Where You'll Grow"

  * I want people who want to grow
  * I want people who have certain characteristics and I think these and their attitude matter more than specific skills, which can be taught

## Authenticity is Key

This is the hard part. I think Job Posts will perform best when they come from someone who's the hiring manager or close to the hiring manager, and who can speak to the highlights of the organization's culture. That's what allows a job description to be infused with authenticity. 


## What were the results?

I had a *number* of candidates I really liked for this position, and in the end, i was able to make offers to two phenomenally talented coders.

In many cases, applicants saw this job post through messages from other professionals in communities who sent it to them and said "this sounds like you", and they felt the job description authentically described a place they wanted to be. That feels like a resounding success.
