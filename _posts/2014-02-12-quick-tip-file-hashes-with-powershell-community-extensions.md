### Problem
I need to calculate the MD5 and SHA hashes for a file from Windows and I'd rather not download 3rd-party GUI software that clutters my setup.

### Solution
I like the [PowerShell Community Extensions][PSCX] for this.

1. Download [Chocolatey Nuget] (it will make your life outside of this post easier, I promise).
1. From the Powershell command prompt, type `cinst pscx`. This will install the PowerShellCommunity Extensions.
1. Use the PSCX syntax to get the hashes. Some examples below:

```powershell
Get-Hash C:\Path\To\File.zip -Algorithm MD5
Get-Hash C:\Path\To\File.zip -Algorithm SHA1
```
