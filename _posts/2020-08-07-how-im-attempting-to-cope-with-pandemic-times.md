Firstly, a disclaimer -- coping is really hard. These are things I've tried; some have worked, some haven't.

* Baby
* Singing and music have been a good outlet. 
* Giving myself permission to learn new things without "producing" has recharged me and brought joy. 
* Trying to restrict my doom scrolling and adding social media breaks.
* Books for sure (audiobooks have really helped; I'll close my eyes and listen to them.)
* Also weirdly enough, writing. Moving some posts forward on my blog puts me in a different headspace where I feel like I'm being creative for myself.
* Lastly, one that surprised me: spending time breaking things I want to do into tiny little tasks. When I feel exhausted, this makes things feel much more approachable, helps me keep moving, which makes me feel good. Like TDD for my productivity; little hits of dopamine.
