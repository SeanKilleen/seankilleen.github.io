I recently helped the NUnit docs team re-launch their documentation at <https://docs.nunit.org>. As the result of this effort, I have been been given -- and accepted -- an invitation to lead [the NUnit docs project](https://github.com/nunit/docs)! I couldn't be more excited to continue to foster learning and growth for a foundational and fundamental tool in the .NET ecosystem. With [over 81 million total downloads on Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit/), we have a large community to support, and I don't take that lightly. 

I have some fun follow-up posts planned about making this happen, but I wanted to reflect a bit on some of the circumstances surrounding how this all came to be in case folks can take something away from the story.

## Trying to be "one of the helpers".

This all started because I saw, and loved, the idea of the [NUnit Analyzers project](https://github.com/nunit/nunit.analyzers). I noticed that some of the documentation was incomplete, so [I submitted a PR to try to assist with that](https://github.com/nunit/nunit.analyzers/pull/206).



## "Why not?" 




## A labor of love

Change is tedious, and we have to stick with it if things are going to happen. 

## Not me; us. (Jump in!)

I'll need your suggestions and your contributions to make it happen.
