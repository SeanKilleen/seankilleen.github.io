I'm very excited to release a talk that has been percolating in my head for a bit. I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this with the world via the [.NET Fringe Conference](http://dotnetfringe.org) earlier this week.

I was even more excited -- and a tiny bit terrified -- to be chosen to kick off the conference!

You can watch the talk, embedded below:

I've also launched a companion site to go along with the talk: <http://AWider.NET>.

I'll be writing a lot more about Fringe and about the mission of AWider.NET in the coming days, but I wanted to take the opportunity to get it out into the wild ASAP.

## Questions? Thoughts? Ideas?

I'd love to hear your feedback on the talk, especially if there's something you don't agree with or think could be improved. Feel free to respond here or on the [AWider.NET Github Site](http://github.com/AWiderDotNet/AWiderDotNet.github.io).
