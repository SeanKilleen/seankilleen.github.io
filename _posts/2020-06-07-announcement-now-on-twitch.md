I've been [starting to stream on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/sjkilleen).

I've only done three sessions but it's been a blast so far. I've been enjoying working/thinking out loud, reasoning through problems when I get stuck, and meeting others in the community.

The best part is, [my employer, Excella](https://excella.com) is allowing me to stream some of the work that I'm doing during the day, which makes it all the more possible. 

I'm also [archiving the streams via YouTube](https://youtube.com/SeanKilleen), so you can feel free to check them out there if you miss a session.

[Follow me on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/sjkilleen), and let's code together!
