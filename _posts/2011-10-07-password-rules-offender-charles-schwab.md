Dear Charles Schwab,

It is 2011. Why do you have a **maximum** length of 8 characters on an account password? And why is the only requirement that there be a number between letters?

It does not inspire confidence when I am about to ask you to hold my money.

**Update:** It also *doesn't allow symbols*. That's right, folks; maximum of 8 characters, and only letters/numbers. I can't believe this crap.

### Update: Two-Factor Authentication Available!
Thanks to Richard Smiley who wrote in the comments to alert us to the fact that Schwab is now offering a two-factor authentication token upon request.

For more details, head to [the SchwabSafe Page]. As of the time of this update (2/21/2013), to request a token, call Schwab at 800-435-4000.
