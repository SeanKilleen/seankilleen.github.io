Hi everyone,

This year, for my 24th birthday, I wanted to do something different. Inspired by Chris Sacca and the Charity: Water project, I want to try to donate $500 by September 30th, which I hope will be easily accomplished.

Please donate here: [Charity: Water -- Sean's 24th Birthday]

I'll appreciate it, but the 25 people (5 families) with clean drinking water will appreciate it the most. I've donated $5 to my own campaign to prove that I'm willing to put my money where my birthday-cake-eating mouth is.

I'm lucky as hell to be where I am, and hope those who know me will help support me in helping others.

Thanks!
