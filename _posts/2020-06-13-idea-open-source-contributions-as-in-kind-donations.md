Could this work?

* Lots of OSS projects have registered 501(3)c orgs, or belong to bigger foundations that do (e.g. .NET Foundation).
* Lots of companies have people with spare cycles
* OSS projects need tie and contributions
* Companies (and even individuals) normally have little economical incentive for someone to contribute

[via LegalZoom](https://info.legalzoom.com/article/what-kind-donation-501c3):

> When a nonprofit organization receives an in-kind contribution, the charity records the gift as revenue. To determine the amount of revenue, the charity must value the in-kind contribution at its [fair market value](https://www.legalzoom.com/knowledge/corporation/glossary/fair-market-value?_ga=2.263870860.1611812806.1592065210-921857059.1591147466) on the date of the donation.

Idea:

* We pioneer the legal aspects of making contributions and tracking them
* We create a bot in concert with GitHub and Microsoft that allows users to request a "receipt" for their time spent.
* We work to help set a legally accepted definition of fair market value for OSS contributions.
* We find a way to help users group their contributions by org
* We celebrate those organizations and individuals and we finally have a $ amount to put to it.

Challenges

* How to track the time spent or calculate the donation? A standard amount? Do we have to trust the people submitting and have them certify it?
