Could this work?

* Lots of OSS projects have registered 501(3)c orgs, or belong to bigger foundations that do (e.g. .NET Foundation).
* Lots of companies have people with spare cycles
* OSS projects need tie and contributions
* Companies (and even individuals) normally have little economical incentive for someone to contribute

Idea:

* We pioneer the legal aspects of making contributions and tracking them
* We create a bot in concert with GitHub and Microsoft that allows users to request a "receipt" for their time spent.
* We find a way to help users group their contributions by org
* We celebrate those organizations and individuals and we finally have a $ amount to put to it.

Challenges

* How to track the time spent or calculate the donation? A standard amount? Do we have to trust the people submitting and have them certify it?
