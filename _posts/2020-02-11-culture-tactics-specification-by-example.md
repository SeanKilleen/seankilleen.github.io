Tactical

* We have tests
* The tests describe things
* Developers might be able to more easily understand

Cultural

* We co-create the application
* We speak in the same language
* Confidence is built by looking at the success of the shared co-creation
* Bug reports start coming in using examples
* User expectations become clear
* The idea of solving by writing a failing test first is embedded
