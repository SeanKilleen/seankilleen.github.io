### Problem
I want to run several installation programs in order, and don't want them to step on each other.

I want to avoid errors such as "another setup program is already running" which result in the second install not completing.

### Solution

For files without arguments, run:

```powershell
$var1 = Start-Process -FilePath "[path]" -passthru
$var1.WaitForExit()
```

For files with arguments, run:

```powershell
$var1 = Start-Process -FilePath "[path]" -ArgumentList "[Args]" -passthru
$var1.WaitForExit()
```

In these examples, `[path]` is the full path to the file (e.g. `C:\SomeFolder\MyProgram.exe`) you want to run. `[Args]` is whatever you'd normally put after the path to the exe in the command line.

**NOTE**: Single quotes around the file path will ensure the command will not break if it includes a space in the path.
