### Why Undertake This (Plus: Look at my Presentation!)

I've seen too many instances in various jobs and projects where the build/integration process is not afforded due diligence (or *any* diligence, really).

I decided I needed to do something about it. Part experiment, part challenge, part reference guide. I'm going to see if I can put together an entire continuous integration / build process for .NET environments from scratch.

Below, you can find [some slides from a presentation I gave at work][SS Link] (and yes, the design ideas are at times ripped directly from [Zach Holman's article][Holman Link] as I tried to emulate his style. He's awesome, and I'm shameless. Credit was given.) This talk highlighted the benefits of inte"great"ion and what I was about to undertake.

### My Goal
In short, dear reader, my end desire is to have a completely integrated build process for .NET using (almost) free and/or open-source tools, and to share my process with you.

The build process so far will include the following:

* Subversion repository on CentOS VM
* An ASP.NET MVC Project Added to the Source control
* Trac web site connected to Subversion repository on CentOS VM
* Build Server VM (Windows Server 2008 R2)
* CruiseControl.NET running on the Build Server
* Building the Project with MSBuild via CCNet
* Building a Release build via CCNet; if successful, publishes to AppHarbor via a cloned git repository
* NUnit Tests
* NCover code coverage metrics
* SpecFlow User Acceptance Test / Feature Test coverage
* Selenium Server as a web driver to execute specflow tests
* Selenium Grid executing tests on multiple OSes / platforms
* Adding FxCop to the mix to check my coding standards
* Adding StyleCop to the mix to make sure the code is consistently written.
* Utilizing Nuget packages and Octopus to transform releases for different environments.

### Hoo-boy, Here We Go

It's a lofty goal -- especially for someone who's not a pro developer -- but I'm excited for everything I'm about to learn during this process.

Onward and Upward!
