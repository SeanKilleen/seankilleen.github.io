_This series, "Culture > Tactics", is an examination of how to change your organization's trajectory rather than merely trying to change its output. Read more in [the introduction](TODO)._

Today's topic is one that is common in a number of development teams: Continuous Integration.

## What a Tactical Approach to Continuous Integration Looks Like

* We have a build server.
* Maybe our build server even runs tests!
* Our build server also deploys!

But this is not continuous integration in the cultural sense. You can do all of the above and still not embrace continuous integration in your culture.

## What a Cultural Approach Looks like

Continuous integration is the commitment to small feedback loops within your development team, and ensuring that changes have an opportunity to work well together before being deployed.

What are some ways that this can manifest itself?

* *We have tiny, short-lived branches.*
* *We don't need to have all of a "story" complete before we push.**
* *We get fast feedback -- from peers and tooling -- often as we work.**
* *We aren't afraid of showing our work early and often*
* *There is no "merge phase" or "integration phase"*
* *Any code we merge can go to production if it needs to.*
* *Quality gateways in the build process.*
