Just a quick tip – one of the things I used to be frustrated with in Outlook was the difficulty to simply send a message to a number of people on an event. Scheduled outages, etc. were difficult to update folks on.

Outlook 2010 has made this much easier with the addition of a “Contact Attendees” button to the event. Look for it on the ribbon for the event. Screenshot below:

Hope you find it useful!
