## Before we begin: A warning

Please recall that throughout preceding articles, I mentioned that the interview process needs to be heavily tailored to the position you're seeking to fill, and to the research you've done on an interviewee.

I mention this again here because it's really important. If you treat the questions below as a one-size-fits-all play book, you will be doing your team and your interviewees a disservice. There is no overall interview play book in my opinion.

The goal of the questions below is to show the types of open-ended questions I might ask to give the candidate space to show and tell me who they are around certain topics. These questions rarely exist on their own, but I usually try to turn them into mini conversations. **The follow-up is key.**

With that said, here are some common questions I tend to ask and my reasoning behind them.

## My Common Interview Questions, and their aims

### Tell me about a recent win you've had. Could be work-related, but doesn't have to be.

* **When I ask this question:** I tend to ask this at the start of an interview, usually as the first question.
* **Why I ask this question:** I've gotten feedback that it allows interviewees to open up and it removes some of the tension because we celebrate the win together. It doesn't start them out in a defensive posture. I also ask this to see where someone's priorities are and what they value as an accomplishment.
* **What sorts of answers do I look for:** I look for someone to have _something_ that they're proud of in work or outside of work, in at least some small way. Fork work-related answers, I also check to see if they've connected that accomplishment to delivering some sort of value for a larger audience. For personal answers, I look to see the ways they value spending their time and I try to relate it to work or to our pitch in future parts of the conversation.

### With so much happening in this industry, how do you keep your skills up to date?

* **When I ask this question:** I sometimes use this question as a go-to when I don't have a good segue between topics, to give me some mental space to queue up something else because it's a question I can pay attention to without it being too much of a burden.
* **Why I ask this question:** Keeping skills up to date is important, and is something that is a struggle for almost any developer.
* **What sorts of answers do I look for:** More than a specific answer, I look to understand that someone has some sort of a plan for themselves, and it's OK if that includes the expectation of learning some things on the job. People learn different ways -- could include reading blogs, Pluralsight or other video training, conferences, or books. I usually ask a follow up question on what someone's favorite resources are, mostly because I'm always looking to expand my list.
* **NOTE**: As I've stated elsewhere in the series, it also needs to be acceptable for someone to say "I don't get a lot of time outside of work for training due to (raising family / taking care of loved ones / really any outside work reason)". In this case, I follow up to ask what kind of learning they'd like to do if they had more bandwidth, and I use the opportunity to plug our professional development opportunities.
