## Problem

Sometimes, for whatever reason, Intellisense will go away in Visual Studio while using ReSharper.

This is a bummer, because Intellisense is a huge help, and very easy to take for granted until it's gone.

## Resolution

Some folks reported having to close and reopen Visual Studio to get this to work, but I was able to fix it in the following way:

* From the ReSharper Menu, choose `Options`:

![Resharper menu]({{site.post-images}}/2013-12-02_ReSharperIssue_01.png)

* From the Intellisense Menu, choose `General`:

![Resharper Intellisense Menu]({{site.post-images}}/2013-12-02_ReSharperIssue_02.png)

* Ensure that `ReSharper` is selected, so you get all that extra goodness:

![General Settings Menu Resharper Selection]({{site.post-images}}/2013-12-02_ReSharperIssue_03.png)

* Click `Save`:

![Clicking the Save button]({{site.post-images}}/2013-12-02_ReSharperIssue_04.png)

At this point, ReSharper appears to refresh its settings and this kicks Intellisense back into action.
