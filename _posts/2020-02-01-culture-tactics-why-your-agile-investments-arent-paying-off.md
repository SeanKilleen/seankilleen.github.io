_This is part of a series called Culture > Tactics, where I attempt to break down some of the misconceptions and how teams should orient themselves towards cultural changes rather than tactical changes._

Frequently, companies begin an "Agile Transformation" or exploration, only to settle for "doing Scrum," "implementing DevOps," or "Kanban boards" as a substitute for real change. This cargo cult mentality and focus on tactical improvement is missing the larger picture. It's not about "being agile" or some half-baked idea of what that means. It's about the real value provided to a business by re-evaluating the way you approach delivering on your company's goals. 

If you're investing in agility but only considering tactical improvements or outcomes, you're going to be stuck wondering why your investments aren't paying off. This article and series talk a bit about the "why." 

## Changing Outputs vs. Changing Trajectory

Too often, companies and their leadership invest in the tactical side of things -- producing "stuff" `x%` faster, releasing `y times` per month. Agile methodologies are seen as a way to improve these metrics.

But what if you were able to put a new lens on your entire organization? What if you were able to challenge assumptions, experiment, build a culture of learning and leadership, focus on organizational clarity and alignment around a vision? Organizations and teams often focus on "up and to the right," but see this as a straight slope or something that teams should achieve quickly and consistently. In reality, if you invest in changing the mindset and culture of your organization, it will take a little more time for those seeds to germinate, and things will bloom unevenly. But when the change shows up, it is more beneficial than you could have imagined.  

I know it's possible. I've seen it done. I've also seen most organizations stop short of it, believing the end-goal impossible, or being unwilling to commit.

## Change is the \*whole point\*

If you're looking for new terms or tools -- Agile, Scrum, SAFe, Kanban -- but are only considering how they fit into your current process/thinking, you may not be going about evolving your organization the right way. The goal is to figure out how your business can be better, more developed to fulfill your organization's vision quickly -- not to put a buzzword bandage on your existing environment. 

So much of what exists in the current agile space centers around "things you can do to make your team fit the definition of Agile." This saddens me, as it falls short on so many fronts. 

## Agile Isn't Something The Developers Do.

Or rather, adopting an agile mindset isn't something that _only the development team_ does.

If the leaders in your company aren't willing to invest themselves in reconsidering how their culture could be improved, they're only considering the tactical approaches to agility. Their ROI will be considerably limited, and their approach could lead to potential backlash.

Leaders need to show up if they want their company to succeed. If you're considering new mindsets, adaptations, and culture, it's essential that the leadership embraces this to create a space where it can thrive. 

Many folks (including me, frequently) reiterate that agility is a mindset, not a methodology. And to think about things differently, you need to ensure that the organizational structure embraces experimenting with different kinds of thought. That has to come from leaders.

I once had a client -- in the role of Product Owner -- tell me, "Agile is just something the developers do to make their lives easier." That is true, but only if we put the very narrow lens of a tactical improvement in place. Over time, we were able to help this stakeholder feel that they were on the same team as us, working toward the same goal, and that bigger bets and a culture of learning actually produced much better results. But it took a long time to build that trust because that stakeholder had something to lose when they reported to their management. The more we can do to encourage experimenting with different approaches at the leadership level, the better. 

## If you're not considering culture, you've already lost

A slightly faster canoe is nothing compared to getting everyone to row together.

It's true: your teams can turn out "stuff" so much faster even with small tactical improvements. But if that stuff isn't serving your customers, it's only creating dead weight in your product. If you're not moving closer to the company's goals, you're only moving further away from them. 

Agility is building into all of your teams the mindset that they should seek to understand and clarify your organization's vision and move your organization or product closer to its goals. Teams should learn along the way how to do this better, and should share and collaborate as they go.  

Don't mistake motion for progress. A giant [subway station-style roadmap to agility](https://www.reddit.com/r/AssurityAgile/comments/5n23e6/the_agile_landscape_v3_by_deloitte/) is not going to save your company's culture, and that's where the real competition -- the competition that decides if you're a dinosaur 5-10 year from now -- is taking place.

## Not everyone benefits from agile tactics. Everyone benefits from agile culture.

Gasp! We don't need everything to be a nail for an agile hammer. 

Your organization may not benefit from something like Scrum in its development efforts. If you're building satellites, much of the logic is rooted in mathematics, where there is often one objectively right solution to a problem. Much of the machine must be designed at the outset -- you're not trying to build a tiny satellite and then iterate to a large one.

That's not to say these companies don't take agility seriously. They have large R&D departments; they invest time in thinking about new ways to design and produce. They run a barrage of tests on their equipment to ensure they have as many feedback loops as possible before launch. 

## This stuff isn't easy. Adjust Your Expectations.

Unsurprisingly, most folks opt for tactical improvements rather than cultural ones because it's easier to see progress, and easier to keep at arm's length. 

A resilient, agile culture is something that takes time to create. Teams and leadership will need to feel empowered to challenge the status quo. They will need to engage -- and wrestle -- with a company's vision, goals, and norms. Trust will need to be built; natural friction and conflict will need to be overcome.

Agility isn't something that comes in a box. It isn't something that consultants alone can bestow on you. It gets to the heart of how your company thinks. 

## Let's Jump In.

Throughout this series, I'll attempt to dive into what certain practices look like when they are approached culturally, rather than tactically, and to showcase the benefits that the cultural approach can yield.
