It appears that the shipped version of Ubuntu Maverick 10.10 (at least the server version) comes with repository server URLs that are incorrect -- or at least non-functioning. I discovered this the hard way after much trial, error, and self-doubt. I hope the masses benefit from my suffering. :)

### The symptoms:
* Can connect to the network
* Can run "sudo apt-get update"
* Can run "sudo apt-get upgrade"
* Cannot run "sudo apt-get install [package name]" for ANY package.

### The Solution:
* Open nano to edit the file:
>sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

* Edit all "http://us.archive.ubuntu.com" to "http://archive.ubuntu.com"
* Uncomment all the lines that start with "deb" or "deb-src" (if you know what you're doing). *NOTE:* Make sure that the text starts the line (i.e. don't leave a space -- bad practice).
* CTRL + X, Y to allow overwrite, enter to save to the current file name.

* Update packages:
> sudo apt-get update

* Upgrade:
> sudo apt-get upgrade

* Badda-bing, it works!

Not sure if this is an ongoing or temporary issue, but hopefully this will be fixed by the team in time one way or another.
