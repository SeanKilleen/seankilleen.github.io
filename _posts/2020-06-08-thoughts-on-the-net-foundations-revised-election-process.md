Claire Ovotny, Director of the .NET Foundation, recently sent out an e-mail about the revised election strategy and policy.

I was [the last one eliminated in the previous election](https://seankilleen.com/2019/05/that-time-almost-became-dotnet-fdn-board-member/), so I figured I would take a few minutes to at least jot down what I like and what could be improved about the new process.

## What I Like

* Diversity of candidates as an explicitly stated goal.
* Term Limits
* Staggered Election, and how it's being implemented.
* Nominating committees as an encouraginging/enabling body 
* Voting system. Same one as last time, that seems to make sense.
* Requirement of time commitment

## What I'm Unsure About

* Nominating Committees as a filter 
* Board-chosen nominating committee. They're not on the committees themselves, but they can choose who is?
* Requirements to be nominated (excepting that of the time commitment). 
* Current board chosen requirements (that would, presumably, favor the current board)
* Voting per seat vs the top candidates winning the seats.
* A desire to filter down to 3 candidates per seat. Why? If an expression is the will of the membership, why filter down so quickly?
