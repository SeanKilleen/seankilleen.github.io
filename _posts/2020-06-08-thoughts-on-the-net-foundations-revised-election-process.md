[Claire Ovotny](https://twitter.com/clairernovotny?lang=en), Director of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/), recently sent out an e-mail about the [revised election strategy and policy](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/election/policy) for this year's elections.

I was [the last one eliminated in the previous election](https://seankilleen.com/2019/05/that-time-almost-became-dotnet-fdn-board-member/), so I figured I would take a few minutes to at least jot down what I like and what I'm unsure about with the overall election process, which I hadn't heard about until Claire's e-mail.

## Before we get started

Lest someone misinterpret the point of this post, I :heart: the .NET Foundation and its board and I think they want the best for the .NET community in general and work hard to achieve those things.

Also, my thoughts below are based on the current policy overall, not the diffs between the old policy and the changed policy.

## What I Like About the Process

* **Diversity of candidates as an explicitly stated goal.** We recognized this need during the last election, and a nominating committee has the ability to ensure that a slate of candidates is diverse.
* **Term Limits.** I like the idea that someone can only serve on a board for a certain amount of time. We need a rotation and I hope we can find a way to honor past board members, perhaps on the Foundation site.
* **Staggered terms, and how it's being implemented.** I like the idea that the some of the board will phase out at different times. I think having the continuity is important. I also like that after this election, the plan is to choose half the board at random for a shorter term. That seems like the fairest way to achieve this goal.
* **Nominating committees as an encouraging/enabling body.** Empowering a nominating committee to seek out and encourage potential candidates is a great way to achieve a diverse slate. I like this as a purpose of the nominating committee.
* **Voting system**. Same one as last time, that seems to make sense. Of course, I wonder if technically we'll be voting in x number of separate elections rather than one election. 
* **Requirement of time commitment**. It seems reasonable that a board member should have to pledge x amount of their time to the purpose and mission of the Foundation.

## What I'm Unsure About

* Nominating Committees as a filter 
* Board-chosen nominating committee. They're not on the committees themselves, but they can choose who is?
* Requirements to be nominated (excepting that of the time commitment). 
* Current board chosen requirements (that would, presumably, favor the current board)
* Voting per seat vs the top candidates winning the seats.
* A desire to filter down to 3 candidates per seat. Why? If an expression is the will of the membership, why filter down so quickly?
* The Foundation's members didn't vote on it. The first ever elected board changed the rules without membership involvement. I'm not sure that's the precedent we want to be setting.
