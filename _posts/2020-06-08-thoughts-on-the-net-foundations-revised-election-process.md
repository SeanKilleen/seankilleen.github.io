[Claire Ovotny](https://twitter.com/clairernovotny), Director of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/), recently sent out an e-mail about the [revised election strategy and policy](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/election/policy) for this year's elections.

I was [the last one eliminated in the previous election](https://seankilleen.com/2019/05/that-time-almost-became-dotnet-fdn-board-member/), so I figured I would take a few minutes to at least jot down what I like and what I'm unsure about with the overall election process, which I hadn't heard about until Claire's e-mail.

## Before we get started

Lest someone misinterpret the point of this post, I :heart: the .NET Foundation and its board and I think they want the best for the .NET community in general and work hard to achieve those things.

Also, my thoughts below are based on the current policy overall, not the diffs between the old policy and the changed policy.

## What I Like About the Process

* **Diversity of candidates as an explicitly stated goal.** We recognized this need during the last election, and a nominating committee has the ability to ensure that a slate of candidates is diverse.
* **Term Limits.** I like the idea that someone can only serve on a board for a certain amount of time. We need a rotation and I hope we can find a way to honor past board members, perhaps on the Foundation site.
* **Staggered terms, and how it's being implemented.** I like the idea that the some of the board will phase out at different times. I think having the continuity is important. I also like that after this election, the plan is to choose half the board at random for a shorter term. That seems like the fairest way to achieve this goal.
* **Nominating committees as an encouraging/enabling body.** Empowering a nominating committee to seek out and encourage potential candidates is a great way to achieve a diverse slate. I like this as a purpose of the nominating committee.
* **Voting system**. Same one as last time, that seems to make sense. Of course, I wonder if technically we'll be voting in x number of separate elections rather than one election. 
* **Requirement of time commitment**. It seems reasonable that a board member should have to pledge x amount of their time to the purpose and mission of the Foundation.

## What I'm Unsure About

* **Nominating Committees as a filter for 3 candidates per seat.** I know there were a lot of candidates last year, but I quite liked that because I enjoyed the many varied ideas and experiences. I became aware of new people and their contributions, etc. Why are many candidates a problem? If an election is the expression of the membership, why filter down so quickly? I think a "primary" would be fine to select down to a certain number, if paring down is necessary. I think the nominating committee won't necessarily be looking for people like me, and I'm not sure that I will make it past a nominating committee in the future. 
* **Board-chosen nominating committee.** Even though the board is not on the nominating committee itself, they still choose who is from what I can tell. While I would trust the current board members to ensure there are no conflicts here, what about future board members? 
* **Requirements to be nominated (excepting that of the time commitment).** Rules/guidelines mean that the elections will select for a certain kind of person. How will change be intoduced if participants are required to come from inside the system? Will we be looking at a slate of the same well-known people from inside the .NET Foundation's ecosystem? I get that this incentivizes others to participate, but I'm not sure it's the best approach. Furthermore, if diversity is a stated goal (and I agree it should be), does it constrain the candidate pool too much? 
* **The current board chose these requirements.** I worry that the requirements therefore can't help but reflect the current make-up of the board. 
* Voting per seat vs the top candidates winning the seats.
* The Foundation's members didn't vote on it. The first ever elected board changed the rules without membership involvement. I'm not sure that's the precedent we want to be setting.
