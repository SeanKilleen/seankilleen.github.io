## The Actual Interview
* **Just before heading in, remember what it's like to interview**. The dread, the lingering feeling afterward on whether you did well, the self-doubt, the headspace you're in, the  muscle memory folks have from past environments and cultures. Remember that no matter what, you want this person to tell other people how good this company would be to work for. Remember that you want them to succeed. Now, you are ready to head into the room.
* **Make sure they feel comfortable**. Ask them if they want a drink of water.* Let them know this is more of a conversation than a quiz, and that you will be sure to leave room for questions.
* **Let them know the agenda**. This allows them to have expectations, and to mentally prepare for what will come after them. 
* **Also, let them know what _won't_ be on the agenda**. Will you not be running a coding exam? Let them know that (and likely listen to that huge, sweet sigh of relief.)
* **Are you taking notes?** Let them know it's just to write down what they said, not to cast judgment in real time.
* **Start off with a "recent win"**. Is there anything -- preferably professional, but outside of work is acceptable -- lately that someone feels is a "win" for them? I like this because people seem to immediately relax. They can talk about something they know from experience, and it kicks the interview off on a positive note. It also tells me something about what the interviewee values and why, and what they consider to be a positive impact in their lives.
