###Benchmarks
This is the desktop, assembled, without the enhanced airflow in the rear and with *no overclocking yet.*

####Windows Experience Score (out of 7.9)
* **Processor:** 7.8 
* **Memory (RAM):** 7.8
* **Graphics:** 7.7
* **Gaming Graphics:** 7.7
* **Hard Drive:** 6.0 (I think the SSD caching hasn't fully kicked in yet)

**PCMark 7 Score**: low 4,000 (~4,100? Forgot the actual number)

**Standard Temperature**: ~89F (hottest of the 5 temp sensors)

**Gaming Temp**: ~93F (tested with Call of Duty: Black Ops)

###Next Steps
* The "overclockening" -- when I feel like it. It runs smooth like butter now and I have no reason to push it (this is going to be part server, after all)
* Increasing the air flow
* Ensuring everything is backed up (Backblaze is chugging along now)
* Moving media/content from External HDD onto Desktop
* Erasing External HDD
* Configuring Windows System backup on HDD
* Virtualization, and tons of it. Setting up a bunch of systems (more posts on why later)

###Also, a Big Thank You
Thanks to John Herron, a former co-worker and excellent techie, I also now have a 20" LCD monitor. The kindness of nerds astounds.

Any ideas for other benchmarks? Let me know!
