The .NET Foundation Board elections recently took place, and I was the last one eliminated, one of my proudest accomplishments to date. 

I thought I’d share some reflections and lessons learned from my candidacy. todo: link

## What led me to here

Todo: community involvement beforehand, why did I do it, deciding to jump in

## Mistakes right out of the gate

Todo: diversity and learning in public 

## Don’t wait for other people to make things better

Todo: PRs and acting the part of a board member

## Why name recognition matters (and doesn’t)

Todo: My twitter following as an outlier, value of ideas and passion

## What I hope comes next
