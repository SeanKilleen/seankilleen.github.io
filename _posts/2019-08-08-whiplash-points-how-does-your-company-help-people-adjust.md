Talking with a colleague recently, I realized some things they'd carried with them from a previous environment. We all bring things with us -- a sort of muscle memory of past experiences and wounds. 

I've found myself using the phrase "this isn't that place" a few times lately to try to describe where my current company's culture, default expectations, or responses to actions are different (and in many cases, better). 

The way my colleague described this is a sort of feeling of whiplash -- being catapulted into an environment that, even if better, is very different than the old environment, and causes a sort of out-of-body feeling at points.
