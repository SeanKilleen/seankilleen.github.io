_TODO: Blurb about what the series is about_ 

## What a Tactical Approach to DevOps looks like

* We have a DevOps team
* We do DevOps by using DevOps tooling

## What a Cultural Approach to DevOps looks like

This approach adheres more closely to CALMS - _**C**_ulture, _**A**_utomation, _**L**_earning, _**M**_easurement, and _**S**_haring
* We know how to run what we build
* We have a shared understanding of how our system works from development through to production
* We are continuously learning and iterating
* We care about our infrastructure as much as our code
* We work to reduce cognitive overhead and automate what we can. 
* There's a very large overlap between our development and operational skillsets
* We understand the measurements that matter for the satisfaction of our users.
