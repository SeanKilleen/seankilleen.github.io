I've seen a lot of meetings go sideways. And with the surge of remote work the past year and a half, we've seen a dramatic increase in remote work and the communication challenges that can go along with it, especially for organizations that aren't adapting to current circumstances.

Dear reader, I'd love to save you that trouble.

## What Do We Mean by "Shift to the Left" here? 

In software development, feedback loops are key. If we can iterate 10 times on something while our competitors are still getting their shoes on, chances are we're going to come out ahead. This ability to adapt and respond to change is one of the driving forces at the heart of Agile software development. 

If we visualize a process as a series of columns from left to right, such as in Kanban, then "shifting to the left" means avoiding issues earlier in the process. For example, if we have a "QA step" and bugs are often found there, could we shift the process to the left by automating tests earlier on to make QA go more smoothly? If a work item gets to a sign-off phase and there are issues, could we work to understand things better up front to avoid that hiccup and achieve a state of flow? 

## Meetings are another form of feedback loop. 

They involve scheduling and logistical acrobatics, they steal focus, they cost a lot of money, and they often lead to more meetings. What can we do to get ahead of these expensive feedback loops, or at least make them smaller? 

## The Best Meeting is No Meeting at All

Meetings should be a value stream. What is the outcome of a meeting? Surely we can get to that outcome faster.

| If your meeting is to... | ..then try this instead | 
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Make an announcement | E-mail, Organization Chat e.g. Slack or Teams |
| Get Feedback | Set up a form and send via e-mail, take a poll in Slack or similar |
| Get consensus |  | 
| Reach people who don't read your e-mails | Accept that those people might be too busy or too disinterested. Maybe they don't need to be involved. If you have a decision to make, make it without them. | 
| Present an award | Private congratulation and a public e-mail announcement? Make a part of another meeting? (NOTE: awards in meetings can be very nice; just do it consciously.) |
| Brainstorm | A meeting might be helpful for this. But ensure you facilitate, do the prep work, and block off time |

## Shift accountability to the left by making a decision first

I got this one from Al Pitampalli's (TODO: Spelling) great book, "Read this before our next meeting." (TODO: Link)

How can we make a decision if we're not doing it as a group in meetings? 

* Find who the accountable person is and get them to make a decision instead. 
* If you're not sure, ask the group to make someone accountable and volunteer for someone to choose you. 
* Did nobody volunteer? Congrats, you're it! Make the decision or drop it.

## Shift attendance to the left with an agenda that you stick to

Ever been in a meeting where you or others realized you weren't really needed halfway through? Painful, right? 

Every meeting invite should contain:

* A clear goal / expected outcome of the meeting
* An idea of why an invitee is invited to the meeting.
* Exactly what discussion points you intend to cover

Beyond just listing that, you have to ensure that you actually stick to it, so if the discussion deviates, others who have opted out (more on this later) will have a chance to duck back.

## Shift noise to the left by encouraging opt-out

Sometimes when you invite people to a meeting, they feel that they _have_ to attend. This leads to a lot of wasted time. 

TODO

## Shift focus to the left by respecting time boundaries
## Shift ambiguity to the left by setting expectations
## Shift questions to the left with prep
## Shift actionability to the left with action items

## A great book for reference

TODO: Reference "read this before our next meeting", note that you probably internalized several tips from it.
