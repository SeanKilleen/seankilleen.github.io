I've seen a lot of meetings go sideways. And with the surge of remote work the past year and a half, we've seen a dramatic increase in remote work and the communication challenges that can go along with it, espeiclaly for organizations that aren't adapting to current circumstances.

Dear reader, I'd love to save you that trouble.

## What Do We Mean by "Shift to the Left" here? 

In software development, feedback loops are key. If we can iterate 10 times on something while our competitors are still getting their shoes on, chances are we're going to come out ahead. This ability to adapt and respond to change is one of the driving forces at the heart of Agile software development. 

If we visualize a process as a series of columns from left to right, such as in Kanban, then "shifting to the left" means avoiding issues earlier in the process. For example, if we have a "QA step" and bugs are often found there, could we shift the process to the left by automating tests earlier on to make QA go more smoothly? If a work item gets to a sign off phase and there are issues, could we work to understand things better up front to avoid that hiccup and achieve a state of flow? 

Meetings are another form of feedback loop. They involve scheduling and logsitcal acrobatics, they steal focus, they cost a lot of money, and they often lead to more meetings. What can we do to get ahead of these expensive feedback loops, or at least make them smaller? 

## The Best Meeting is No Meeting at All

In his great book, [Read This Before our Next Meeting: How we Can Get More Done](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159184827X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=159184827X&linkCode=as2&tag=seankilleen04-20&linkId=3502665af4119fc46b3d65bb83ff59d7), Al Pittampalli 

* Best meeting is no meeting
* Shift accountability to the left my making a decision first.
* Shift attendance to the left with an agenda
* Shift noise to the left by encouraging opt out
* Shift ambiguity to the left by setting expectations
* Shift questions to the left with prep
* Shift actionability to the left with action items

 meetings as a value stream. What is the outcome of a meeting? Surely we can get to that outcome faster.
