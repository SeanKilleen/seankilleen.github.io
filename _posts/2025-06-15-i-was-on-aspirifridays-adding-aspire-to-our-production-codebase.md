I had a great time on AspiriFridays with Maddy Montiquilla, Damien Edwards, and David Pine. We went through one of SCT's products and added .NET Aspire. This was a pure experiment -- I'd never used Aspire before and was only passingly familiar. I think it worked out really well -- I learned a ton, we hit some real-world considerations and trade-offs, and in the end it was a success!

I haven't gotten to merge the PR into our codebase yet but that's purely due to other priorities. I'm excited to get it in soon. I definitely wish Aspire has been around when I was building our app's infrastructure originally.
