Hello, everyone! Since redirecting the SeanKilleen.com domain name to WordPress, I’ve been trying to invest more time into revamping the look and content of the site.

Initially developed as a place to archive old English papers (which I ~~will leave up for humor’s sake~~ have since taken down), I’d like to turn this space into a place to discuss technology, theatre, and whatever else suits my fancy.

I look forward to any feedback and hopefully your readership in the future!
