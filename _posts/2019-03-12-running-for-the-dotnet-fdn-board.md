I'm excited to announce [my candidacy for the .NET Foundation's Board of Directors](https://election.dotnetfoundation.org/campaign-2019/sean-killeen.html)!

I believe transparent, community-focused governance and OSS involvement is vital to the future of .NET's success, and I'd be excited to support that however I can.

## I'm interested in your thoughts!

This post is short because my candidacy page has most of my thoughts, but I'm more interested in what *you* think.

* What are the challenges facing the .NET Foundation?
* How are you looking to be represented?
* What do you think a .NET Foundation board member should be doing to support the .NET community?
* Is there anything you wish you knew about the Foundation, me, or my candidacy?

I created a process and submitted some PRs so that you can [ask questions of all the .NET Foundation Board candidates](https://election.dotnetfoundation.org/questions)! I hope you'll do so.
