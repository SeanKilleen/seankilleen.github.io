While circumventing your workplace's chat policy is never necessarily a wise thing, if your office place blocks Google Chat, you can (partially) circumvent this to allow Google Chat with folks in your Google+ circles.

To do so:

* Sign into Google+.
* On the `home` tab, you should see a notification about being able to chat with your circles.
* Click `OK`, and your contacts will appear on the home screen with standard gchat-like indicators.

Some things of note so far:

* Your friends' job titles take the place of chat statuses within Google+ chat
