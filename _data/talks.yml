    description: This presentation sought to explain the pleasantly symbiotic relationship between a build server such as TeamCity and a release tool, such as OctopusDeploy. There weren’t as many .NET-focused developers there as expected, and time was a little short, but I’m looking forward to making some tweaks to this one and giving it again soon.

    description: A revised update of a previous Akka.NET introductory presentation. I’ll endeavor to explain concepts and benefits behind the actor model, show how Akka.NET enables such a model with relative ease, and demonstrate some of the top features of the framework via code samples / demos. I have some additional time this go-round, so I’m hoping I’ll be able to add some more code samples.

Along the way, we’ll discuss Chocolatey, deployment slots, nuget packages, and more. We’ll also touch on Appveyor and some other Azure deployment methods, as well as the “why” of CI/CD.
