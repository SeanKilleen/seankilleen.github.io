    description: This presentation sought to explain the pleasantly symbiotic relationship between a build server such as TeamCity and a release tool, such as OctopusDeploy. There weren’t as many .NET-focused developers there as expected, and time was a little short, but I’m looking forward to making some tweaks to this one and giving it again soon.

    description: A revised update of a previous Akka.NET introductory presentation. I’ll endeavor to explain concepts and benefits behind the actor model, show how Akka.NET enables such a model with relative ease, and demonstrate some of the top features of the framework via code samples / demos. I have some additional time this go-round, so I’m hoping I’ll be able to add some more code samples.

In this introductory talk, Sean will walk you through the concepts of the actor model, its benefits over traditional approaches, and the basics of how to use Akka.NET to achieve these advantages in your .NET applications.

    description: "Functional testing is a great way to ensure we're not just building the thing right, but building the right thing. In this session, we'll examine the testing pyramid, the place of functional testing, and how to write Gherkin syntax with SpecFlow to move toward acceptance test driven development. We'll use a real world sample to show a few cycles of acceptance tests in the language of the business, and talk about one project's real-world functional testing journey."
