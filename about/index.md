# I want YOU!

See a typo? Come across an issue? You can [create an issue report][new issue link] or even better, [fork this repository][fork link], fix the issue yourself, and submit it as a pull request. 

I'll be setting up a contributors page soon to acknowledge any help I get!

# This Site Runs On:

* Dunkin (in all seriousness, there is probably some considerable caffeine to blame for this).
* The [Jekyll][jekyll link] markdown blogging platform (which is run on [Ruby][ruby link]
	* The [jekyll-sitemap][jekyll-sitemap link] gem
    * The [octopress][octopress link] gem
	* The [jekyll-redirect-from][jekyll-redirect-from link] gem (saved my butt when trying to redirect my old Blogger pages).
* All of this is hosted (for free!) On [Github pages][github-pages link], because they're awesome.
* The [Minimal Mistakes theme][minimal mistakes link] (which I tweaked a bit).
* Comments are hosted on [Disqus][disqus link].
* Want to know what's in the pipeline? I'm using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SeanKilleen/seankilleen.github.io/issues) to track things. Or you can just drop me a line and ask.
* Source code is being formatted by [Google Code Prettify][prettify link].
* A [great blog post at RealJenius](http://realjenius.com/2012/11/03/jekyll-series-list/) describing how to set up a series post in Jekyll without plug-ins. Some nice liquid formatting craziness in there. Learned a lot.

Thanks to all of these things, I can host this small chunk of my brain on the internet.

# Credits

* I think much credit is due to [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/). He inspired me with the idea that the entirety of a blog could be collaborative, and his posts on it removed some of the fear for me. I'll be stealing a number of ideas directly from him, including an edit link for every page, and a link to submit new issues.
* Thanks to [David Coyle][coyled github] for his [atom.xml template for Jekyll][atom.xml link].
* Thanks to [Nick Williams][Nick Williams link] for a [great gist][nick gist link] on bringing google code prettify into my posts
* Thanks to [Pat Hawks][Pat Github] for helping [fix][pat 1] [several][pat 2] [issues][pat 3] early on. Thanks, Pat!
