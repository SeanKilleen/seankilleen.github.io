## This Site Runs On:

* Dunkin (in all seriousness, there is probably some considerable caffeine to blame for this).
* The [Jekyll][jekyll link] markdown blogging platform (which is run on [Ruby][ruby link])
	* The [jekyll-sitemap][jekyll-sitemap link] gem
    * The [octopress][octopress link] gem
	* The [jekyll-redirect-from][jekyll-redirect-from link] gem (saved my butt when trying to redirect my old Blogger pages).
* All of this is hosted (for free!) On [Github pages][github-pages link], because they're awesome.
* The [Minimal Mistakes theme][minimal mistakes link] (which I tweaked a bit).
* Comments are hosted on [Disqus][disqus link].

Thanks to all of these things, I can host this small chunk of my brain on the internet.
