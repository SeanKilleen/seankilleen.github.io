These lovely people have contributed a fix to my blog. If you want to see yourself in this list, send me a pull request!

Every post in my blog has an edit link that lets you edit the blog post directly in the browser and automatically sends me a pull request.

Or [visit my repository]({{site.github.repository_url}}) and send me a pull
request the old fashioned way.

## General Credits

* I think much credit is due to [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/). He inspired me with the idea that the entirety of a blog could be collaborative, and his posts on it removed some of the fear for me. His blog is the reason that I have an edit link, an issue submission link, and, well, this credits page. He's a constant source of inspiration.
* Thanks to [Pat Hawks][Pat Github] for helping [fix][pat 1] [several][pat 2] [issues][pat 3] early on. Thanks, Pat!
